\textbf{Abstract}

Flavonoids are an important class of natural compounds and make up a large part of the world's biomass.
Due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, many health benefits are associated with flavonoids and there is a growing interest to use flavonoids in medicinal  and dietary contexts.
The availabilty of methods that provide for a  quick and reliable identification of flavonoids from different sources is therefore essential.
In this work a range of flavonoids was studied using \glsentryfirst{lcms}.
Two modes of activation, namely \gls{cid} and \gls{hcd}, were evaluated to study fragmentation of flavonoids from their [M+H]\textsuperscript{+} molecular ions.
It was found, that \gls{hcd} outperformed \gls{cid} in the ring-fragmentations of methylated flavonoids.
Together, both methods provide complementary information that can be used to distinguish different types of flavonoids.

\section{Introduction}

\Gls{lcmsms} has been widely used for the on-line identification of compounds from complex samples, such as crude mixtures from plant or bacterial extracts and is an unexpendable method in the field of metabolomics \cite{Sawada2013,Lu2014,Ernst2014,Liebeke2012}.

Ionization of samples in \gls{lcmsms} instruments is usually achieved by mild methods operating at atmospheric pressure, such as \gls{esi} \cite{Whitehouse1985} or \gls{apci} \cite{Horning1974}.
However, small molecules rarely produce fragment ions under these conditions and usually only the \mz of the molecular ion is observed.
A range of different approaches has been used to circumvent this draw-back.
The most direct approach is to use \gls{ei}, where the analytes are bombarded with electrons, for ionization. 
However, \gls{ei} is a vacuum method and the coupling with \gls{lc}-systems is not trivial \cite{Venzie2007}.
In order to still generate fragments in \gls{lcms} \gls{msms} methods such as \glsentryfirst{cid} or \gls{sid} were developed \cite{Sleno2004}.

Flavonoids comprise a huge chemical space, with millions of theoretical structures \cite{Williams2004}.
Due to their biological activities and associated health benefits, applications to quickly identify and characterize these compounds are of special interest.
Already, a number of studies have been published that show how \gls{msms}-approaches using \gls{cid} can aid in the structural characterization of flavonoids \cite{Chen2012,Cuyckens2004,Fabre2001,Gates2012,Hughes2001,Lee2005,Li2014,Ma1997,March2004,March2008}.
Researchers have reported that specifc patterns of fragmentation along the C-ring can be observed for different classes of flavonoids and can help differentiate between them \cite{Ma1997, Cuyckens2004}.
However, it was found that the cleavage of the C-ring is less commonly observed for flavonoids methylated at the B-ring, while the loss of small molecules becomes predominant \cite{Ma1997, Cuyckens2004}.

Fragments of flavonoid aglycones can be represented by a systematic nomenclature first proposed by Ma \etal \cite{Ma1997}.
The labels \frag{\textit{i,j}}{A}{+} and \frag{\textit{i,j}}{B}{+} refer to fragments containing an intact A or B ring, with the superscripts \textit{i} and \textit{j} denoting the bonds of the C-ring that were broken (\autoref{fig:ion_nomenclature}).

  \caption{Ion fragment nomenclature of flavonoid aglycones as proposed by Ma \etal, illustrated on naringenin. Ions are labelled according to the ring they contain and the positions of the C ring that were broken. Thus \frag{\textit{1,3}}{A}{+}, contains the ring A and bonds 1 and 3 of the C ring were broken.}

In this work the complementarity of two activation methods, \gls{cid} and \glsentryfirst{hcd}, for the structural characterization of flavonoids (\autoref{tab:LCMSsubstrates}), especially those methylated at the B-ring, in positive ionization mode was evaluated.
%The main focus of this study were flavonoids methylated at the B-ring.

\section{Fragmentation of flavanones}

Positive ionization MS\tup{2} spectra of flavanones (\autoref{tab:x_flavanonfrag}) are mostly characterized by a base peak at \mz{153}, which corresponds to the A-ring of the flavonoid skeleton (\autoref{fig:flavanone_genfrag}).
Even when \mz{153} was not the base peak, it was still dominant in the spectrum with intensities ranging between \SI{20}{\percent} and \SI{77}{\percent}.
Peaks corresponding to the  molecular ions [M+H]\tup{+} were not observed for any of the flavanones.
The structure of the  ion \frag{1,3}{A}{+} corresponding to \mz{153} is the same for all compounds \molref{naringenin} to \molref{hed} (\autoref{fig:flavanone_genfrag}).
Peaks corresponding to \mz{} values of the respective (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H) ions are also present in the mass spectra of each flavanone.
Apart from the ions \frag{1,3}{A}{+} and (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H), the \gls{cid}- and \gls{hcd}-mass spectra of the flavanones differ significantly.
\Gls{cid} mainly triggers neutral losses directly from the molecular ion. 
Losses of water (\SI{18}{\dalton}) and one or two ketene units (\cf{C2H2O}, \SI{42}{\dalton}) are predominant and afford ions of relatively high masses (\autoref{fig:flavanone_genfrag}) \cite{Kang2007}.

Fragment ions from cleavage of the C-ring (\frag{1,3}{A}{+} and (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H)) further decomposed under the higher energy conditions in \gls{hcd} experiments.
Thus, the resulting \gls{hcd} spectra generally display smaller \mz{} than the \gls{cid} spectrum (\autoref{fig:ed_msspec}).
Increasing the \gls{nce} from \num{75} to \SI{100}{\percent} in \gls{hcd} experiments further increased fragmentation.
This is made clear by the increasing intensities of smaller fragments upon raising the \gls{nce} (\autoref{fig:ed_msspec}).

  \end{figureframe}
  \caption{Major fragmentation pathways of flavanones.  Activation using \gls{cid} conditions at \SI{45}{\percent} \gls{nce} mainly results in neutral losses of \cf{H2O} and ketene (\cf{C2H2O}) from the molecular ion [M+H]\textsuperscript{+} (bold frame).
    These neutral losses are scarcely observed when \gls{hcd} with a \gls{nce} of \SI{75}{\percent} or \SI{100}{\percent} is used for activation. 
    Here, C-ring cleavages followed by neutral losses from the cleavage fragments are dominant.%

  \end{figureframe}
  \caption{Proposed MS\tup{2} fragmentation of \frag{1,3}{A}{+} after \gls{hcd} activation. 
    In high energy MS\tup{2} experiments, \frag{1,3}{A}{+} might loose two \cf{CO} followed by an unusual \cf{C2H4}. A single loss of ketene (\cf{C2H2O}) to afford m/z\,111 is also sensible.%
}
  \label{fig:ms2_13A}
\end{figure}

Further fragmentation of ion (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H) seems to depend on the substituents of the B-ring.
Only (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H) from eriodictyol \molref{ed} loses a water, as suggested by a peak at \mz{145}.
However, the loss of \cf{CO} is the most prominent decomposition of (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H).
The intensities of the peaks corresponding to the (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H-CO) fragment were as high as \SI{36}{\percent} in \gls{hcd} experiments (\autoref{fig:ed_msspec}).
Naringenin \molref{naringenin} seems to sequentially lose two \cf{CO} in \gls{hcd} mode to afford \mz{91} (intensities at \num{75} and \SI{100}{\percent} \gls{nce} at \num{24} and \SI{100}{\percent}, respectively).
This \mz{} is a strong indicator of a benzylium or tropylium cation (\autoref{fig:flavanone_genfrag}).

%
Decay of (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H) of the other flavanones likely leads to a stable bicyclo[4.1.0]heptatrienyl cation as the high intensity of peak \mz{89} in \gls{hcd} mode suggests.
Methylated flavanones \molref{ponciretin}, \molref{hesperetin} and \molref{hed} show a loss of \cf{CO} followed by a loss of a methyl radical (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H-CO-CH3$\mathrm{^\cdot}$), as suggested by the respective \mz{} values  of 118 and 134.
Another \cf{CO} loss from this fragment is possible for ponciretin \molref{ponciretin} to produce an ion \mz{90}, which is at \SI{49}{\percent} intensity in the \gls{hcd} spectrum recorded with \gls{nce} of \SI{75}{\percent} .
The evidence suggests, that this ion's structure is best described by a benzylium/tropylium radical cation (\autoref{fig:flavanone_genfrag}).
%
It is proposed, that ion \frag{1,3}{A}{+} can decompose via two different pathways under \gls{hcd} conditions (\autoref{fig:ms2_13A}).
A loss of ketene from \frag{1,3}{A}{+} results in \mz{111}.
Pyranone (\molnum{pyranone}) is suggested as a structure for this ion. 
Sequential losses of two \cf{CO} and a \cf{C2H4} could afford ion (\molnum{propanedion}).
However, further MS\tup{n} experiments are necessary to confirm these proposals.

%% The \gls{cid}-spectra of the fragmentation of the different flavanones are summarized in \autoref{tab:ions_flavanones}.
%% The molecular ion of either compound was never observed (rel. intensity $<$ 0.5).
%% Neutral losses of water and \cf{C2H2O} were common and the highest \gls{mz} observed always corresponded to the [M+H-\cf{H2O}]\textsuperscript{+} ion.
%% The most prominent peaks in the \gls{cid} spectra stemmed from cleavages of the C-ring and matched the \frag{1,3}{A}{+} and (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H) ions.

%% \Gls{hcd}-spectra of \molref{ponciretin} and \molref{hesperetin} were recorded and turned out to be quite different from the corresponding \gls{cid}-spectra (\autoref{tab:cmp_flavanones}).
%% The higher energy used for the activation via \glsentrytext{hcd} shifts the recorded peaks to smaller \mz.
%% High-mass ions stemming from neutral losses were not observed in the \gls{hcd} spectra.
%% Instead, \gls{hcd} seems to give rise to smaller ions that originate primarily from C-ring cleavage.
%% The ion with \mz{153} was most abundant in \gls{hcd} spectra, as indicated by the corresponding peak with a relative intensity of \SI{100}{\percent}.
%% This is notably different from the \gls{cid} spectra, where the \mz associated with the (\frag{1,4}{B}{+}-2H) ion is at \SI{100}{\percent}.

\section{Fragmentation of flavones}%\footnote{A general fragmentation scheme for flavones is not as easily constructable as for flavanones. Important observeations in general: 1. methylated flavones hardly fragment in CID mode, rather only [M+H-CH3]+ is observed. 2. Fragmentation can be achieved in HCD mode (m/z 153). 3. When fraghmented, methylated and unmethylated flavones show completely different fragments.}

The principle fragmentation of flavone aglycones apigenin \molref{apigenin}, luteolin \molref{luteolin}, acacetin \molref{acacetin} and chrysoeriol \molref{chrysoeriol} in positive mode \gls{cid} tandem mass spectrometry was discussed previously \cite{Ma1997,Kuhn2003}.
Non-methylated (\molref*{apigenin}, \molref*{luteolin}) and methylated flavones (\molref*{acacetin} -- \molref*{chrysoeriol}) show significantly different MS\tup{2} spectra (\autoref{tab:x_flavonfrag}).
ApigenÃ­n \molref{apigenin} and luteolin \molref{luteolin} MS\tup{2} spectra show a characteristic \mz{153}, corresponding to the \frag{1,3}{A}{+} ion, as a base peak in \gls{cid} mode and at low activation energies in \gls{hcd} mode (\autoref{fig:flavone_genfrag}).
Contrary to the flavanones, the MS\tup{2} of unmethylated flavones show the peak corresponding to the molecular ion [M+H]\tup{+}, which is strongest in \gls{hcd} at \gls{nce} of \SI{75}{\percent}.
Characteristic neutral losses of water, \cf{CO} and ketene (\cf{C2H2O}) were also observed for \molref{apigenin} and \molref{luteolin} (\autoref{fig:flavone_genfrag}, \autoref{tab:x_flavonfrag}).
MS-peaks corresponding to a loss of a formyl radical, resulting in [M+H-CHO]\tup{\textbullet+} were also observed for \molref{apigenin} and \molref{luteolin}.
Loss of ketene is proposed to proceed via two different pathways, such that further neutral losses of another ketene, or \cf{C2H2} might be explained (\autoref{fig:flavone_genfrag}).
Besides the characteristic \frag{1,3}{A}{+} fragment, apigenin \molref{apigenin} and luteolin \molref{luteolin} MS\tup{2} spectra also present peaks corresponding to the B-ring fragments \frag{1,3}{B}{+} (\mz{119} and 135) and \frag{0,4}{B}{+} (\mz{163} and 179).
From the mass differences of these fragments, the substitution on the B-ring can be deduced.
The \frag{0,4}{B}{+} ion might further degrade by neutral losses of ketene (\SI{32}{\dalton}) or water (\SI{18}{\dalton}).
The base peaks at a \gls{nce} of \SI{100}{\percent} in \gls{hcd}, \mz{91} \molref{apigenin} and \mz{89} \molref{luteolin}, are most likely due to a further decomposition of \frag{1,3}{B}{+} in a fashion similar to the flavanones to afford a benzylium or bicycloheptatrienyl cation respectively (\autoref{fig:flavone_genfrag}).

The most noteable difference between the methylated and unmethylated representatives is the almost complete lack of any fragmentation of the methylated flavones other than a methyl loss, in \gls{cid} experiments (\autoref{tab:x_flavonfrag}, \autoref{fig:chrysoeriol_msspec}).
A relatively stable radical cation is formed after the loss of a methyl group, due to the fact that the whole system is essentially conjugated (\autoref{fig:meflavon_stability}).

Any other loss would break this conjugation and therefore requires a higher activation energy.

    Losses of \cf{CH3}\tup{textbullet} and \cf{CH4}, followed by loss of \cf{CO} are the major fragmentations observed in the corresponding MS spectra. However, multiple losses of \cf{CO} only occur after a loss of methane (\cf{CH4}), possibly due to the relative stability of the benzochromenylium radical (\molnum{benzochromenylium}). At \SI{100}{\percent} \gls{nce} even higher order fragmentations were observed. %
  }

\end{figure}

Further losses from [M+H-\cf{CH3}-\cf{CO}]\tup{\textbullet+}, with the proposed structure of a benzochromenylium radical (\molnum{benzochromenylium}), were not observed (\autoref{fig:flavone_genfrag}, \autoref{tab:x_flavonfrag}).
Mass-to-charge ratios of 241 \molref{acacetin} and 257 (\molref*{diosmetin}, \molref*{chrysoeriol}) were attributed to a neutral loss of methane (\cf{CH4}), followed by a loss of \cf{CO} (\autoref{fig:flavone_genfrag}, \autoref{fig:chrys_frag}).
Interestingly, the abundance of a peak corresponding to a [M+H-\cf{CH4}]\tup{+} ion was below \SI{1}{\percent} in all spectra, illustrating its susceptibility for additional losses.
The fragment [M+H-\cf{CH4}-\cf{CO}]\tup{+} on the other hand might undergo further neutral losses of up to three \cf{CO} (compounds \molref*{chrysoeriol} and \molref*{diosmetin}) as is illustrated for chrysoeriol in \autoref{fig:chrys_frag}.
However, instead of additional \cf{CO} losses, fragment [M+H-\cf{CH3}-2\cf{CO}]\tup{\textbullet+} of \molref{chrysoeriol} or \molref{diosmetin} might as well loose a \cf{C2H2} (\autoref{fig:chrys_frag}), as suggested by the MS\tup{2} spectra (\autoref{tab:x_flavonfrag}).
%
The only C-ring fragmentation of the methylated flavones (\molref*{acacetin}--\molref*{chrysoeriol}) occurs at positions 1/3, as the observed \mz{153} (\frag{1,3}{A}{+}) suggests.
The higher energy MS\tup{2} spectra suggest, that the \frag{1,3}{A}{+} fragment might deteriorate further in the same manner as described for the flavanones (\autoref{fig:ms2_13A}). 
Numerous minor peaks in the MS\tup{2} \gls{hcd} spectra of compounds (\molref*{acacetin}--\molref*{chrysoeriol}) could not be assigned a fragment or structure, but many even numbered \mz{} values suggest quite complex rearrangements.

The general trend of smaller sized fragments at higher activation energies is also true for flavones (\autoref{fig:chrysoeriol_msspec}).

\section{Fragmentation of flavonols}

The principle fragmentation pathways of kaempferol \molref{kaempferol}, quercetin \molref{quercetin}, myricetin \molref{myricetin} and isorhamnetin \molref{isorhamnetin} in \gls{cid} tandem mass spectrometry have been previously reported \cite{Wolfender2000,Ma1997,March2004}.
Other than flavones, methylated and non-methylated flavonols share similar fragment(ation)s.
Whereas in \gls{cid} methylated flavons hardly showed any fragmentation beyond a methyl loss, methylated flavonoles kaempferide \molref{kaempferide} and isorhamnetin \molref{isorhamnetin} exhibited the same losses as their unmethylated couterparts, albeit at a much lower level (\autoref{tab:x_flavonolfrag}, \autoref{fig:flavonole_genfrag} and \ref{fig:isorhamnetin_msspec}).
These observations are in full agreement with previous reports \cite{Ma1997} and hold true in \gls{cid} as well as \gls{hcd} measurements.
The observed losses from the molecular ion [M+H]\tup{+} are essentially the same as those that were described for the flavones (\molref*{apigenin}, \molref*{luteolin}) (compare \autoref{fig:flavonole_genfrag} and \ref{fig:flavone_genfrag}).
Lots of high intensity peaks presented in the MS\tup{2} spectra of flavonoles and the base peaks changed between compounds.
The base peak of \molref{kaempferol} in the \gls{cid} spectra was at \mz{165}, which corresponds to the \frag{0,2}{A}{+} fragment (\autoref{fig:flavonole_genfrag}).
The signals \mz{257} and 273 corresponding to the [M+H-\cf{H2O}]\tup{+} ions were the base peak in the \gls{cid}-MS\tup{2} spectra of \molref{quercetin} and \molref{myricetin} respectively.
%However the signal corresponding to the [M+H-\cf{H2O}]\tup{+} ion
The [M+H-\cf{CH3}]\tup{\textbullet+} ions were highly abundant in the \gls{cid} experiments of \molref{kaempferide} and \molref{isorhamnetin}.
The base peak of \molref{isorhamnetin} \mz{302}  corresponds to this fragment.
Fragment (\frag{0,3}{A}{+}+2H) fits the \mz{139}, which was the base peak in the \gls{cid} spectrum of \molref{kaempferide}.
The MS signal \mz{153} corresponding to fragment \frag{1,3}{A}{+} was at low abundance in \gls{cid} spectra, especially for the methylated falvonols (\autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_msspec}).
However, in \gls{hcd} experiments \mz{153} was the base peak of all flavonols, except kaempferide \molref{kaempferide} where \mz{229} was at \SI{100}{\percent} relative intensity.

Neutral losses of \cf{CO}, water or a formyl radical are suggested by the collected spectra (\autoref{fig:flavonole_genfrag}, \autoref{tab:x_flavonolfrag}).
Only for kaempferol \molref{kaempferol}, a neutral loss of \SI{42}{\dalton} corresponding ketene was observed.

However, MS\tup{2} spectra of all flavonols, except \molref{isorhamnetin}, contained signals that could be assigned to the ion [M+H-2\cf{C2H2O}]\tup{+}, suggesting a loss of two ketene units.
This advocates the notion that the [M+H-\cf{C2H2O}]\tup{+} ion of flavonols might be highly unstable.
Other than the flavones, flavonoles can loose two sequential \cf{CO} and another \cf{C4H4O2}, confirming previously published data \cite{Ma1997}.
The spectra furthermore suggest, that the [M+H-\cf{H2O}-\cf{CO}]\tup{+} fragment of flavonols can loose another \SI{42}{\dalton} (\cf{C2H2O}), which was not spotted previously.
The data also clearly show, that neutral losses off of the molecular ion are most abundant in \gls{cid} experiments, whereas the shift to smaller masses in \gls{hcd} experiments is obvious (\autoref{tab:x_flavonolfrag}, \autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_msspec}).

The studied flavonoles all displayed an MS signal at \mz{153} corresponding to the \frag{1,3}{A}{+} fragment, just as the flavanones and flavones with a 5,7-dihydroxy-substitution of the A-ring did.
This further highlights the diagnostic nature of the \frag{1,3}{A}{+} fragment of flavonoids in \gls{msms} spectra.
At higher energies, \frag{1,3}{A}{+} can further decompose in a manner discussed in the previous sections (\autoref{fig:ms2_13A}). 
Characteristic ring cleavage fragments of flavonols include \frag{0,2}{A}{+}, \frag{0,2}{B}{+} and \frag{1,3}{B}{+}-2H \cite{Ma1997,March2004}, all of which were confirmed in the present study.
Overall, the intensity of the \frag{0,2}{A}{+} and \frag{1,3}{B}{+}-2H fragments decreased in \gls{hcd} over \gls{cid} experiments, whereas the intesity of ions \frag{0,2}{A}{+}-CO, \frag{0,2}{B}{+} and \frag{1,3}{A}{+} increased (\autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_msspec}).
%An interesting trend was observed for the \frag{0,2}{A}{+} fragment in \gls{cid} experiments: increasing substitution on the B-ring correlates with a decrease in ion abundance.

Apart from the discussed fragmentations, MS\tup{2} spectra of the methylated flavonols \molref{kaempferide} and \molref{isorhamnetin} also showed fragmentations typical of methyl esters, namely methyl, methane and methanol loss.

%
Methyl and methane loss followed by sequential losses of carbon monoxide were already shown for flavones (\molref*{acacetin}--\molref*{chrysoeriol}) and are postulated to proceed in a similar manner in flavonols \molref{kaempferide} and \molref{isorhamnetin} (\autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_frag}).
Because of the extra hydroxyl at the C-ring, methylated flavonols such as isorhamnetin can loose two \cf{CO} instead of just one after loss of a methyl radical (compare \autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_frag} and (\autoref{fig:chrys_frag})).
Other than flavones, spectra of methylated flavonols \molref{kaempferide} and \molref{isorhamnetin} also showed signals (\mz{269} and  \mz{285}) corresponding to a loss of methanol.
The data suggests, that these [M+H-\cf{CH3OH}]\tup{+} fragments can loose up to two \cf{CO}, similar to the loss of water and \cf{CO} (\autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_frag} and \ref{fig:flavonole_genfrag}).

    Some fragmentations were observed in \gls{hcd} mode only (box).%

  \label{fig:isorhamnetin_frag}
\end{figure}
%
The peaks with \mz{301}, 273, 245, 217 and 189 in the \gls{hcd} spectra of isorhamnetin \molref{isorhamnetin}, suggest a loss of up to four \cf{CO} after the inital loss of methane (\autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_frag}).
As mentioned before, the smaller mass fragments corresponding to multiple neutral losses are more pronounced at higher activation energies and were thus limited to \gls{hcd} experiments at a \gls{nce} of \SI{100}{\percent} (\autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_msspec}, \autoref{fig:isorhamnetin_frag}).



\section{Conclusions and Discussion}

This comprehensive study shows that, taken together, data from \gls{cid} and \gls{hcd} experiments can be complementary to give a much deeper understanding of structural features of flavonoids.
Mass errors were calculated for each postulated fragment and ranged from \SIrange{0.4}{10}{\ppm}, highlighting the accuracy of the instrument which also allowed for the accurate determination of molecular formulas from MS signals.

The complementary nature of \gls{cid} and \gls{hcd} is especially stricking, when comparing spectra of \molref{diosmetin} and \molref{chrysoeriol}.
\Gls{cid} fragmentation of these B-ring methylated flavones afforded MS spectra, where a methyl loss was by far the dominant fragmentation.
\Gls{hcd} on the other hand provided higher order fragmentations combined with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, for a deeper insight into structural features.
These higher order fragmentations were accelerated by increasing the activation energy, but interpretability of the corresponding spectra was limited.
However, with the help of \textit{in silico} methods for the interpretation of \gls{msms} spectra \cite{Bocker2008,Wolf2010} and the computing power available today, the information contained in highly complex spectra might become more easily accecible.
Nonetheless, fine-tuning of the activation energy is an option to optimize fragmentation intensities, especially of the C-ring fragmentations.

Flavones and flavonols share similar patterns of fragmentation and display a loss of a \cf{CHO} radical, which distinguishes their MS\tup{2} spectra from those of the flavanones.
Distinguishing characteristics between MS\tup{2} spectra of flavones and flavonols are the C-ring fragmentations, where the \frag{0,4}{B}{+} fragment was typically limited to flavones, whereas a (strong) \frag{0,2}{A}{+} fragment was only observed for (unmethylated) flavonols.
While methylated flavanones did not differ in their fragmentations from their non-methylated analogues, MS spectra of methylated and non-methylated flavones and flavonols showed significant differences.
Noticable loss of \cf{CH3}\tup{\textbullet} or \cf{CH4}, followed by losses of \cf{CO} were typical signs of methylated flavones or flavonols.
Loss of methanol was observed in methylated flavonols and in small amounts at \SI{100}{\percent} \gls{nce} in flavones, not however in the MS\tup{2} spectra of flavanones.
Under the right conditions, all of the studied 5,7-dihydroxy substituted flavonoids presented a \frag{1,3}{A}{+} ion, with a characteristic \mz{153}.
This information might be of value for studies that want to determine the position of a derivatization of the flavonoid core.
To the authors knowledge, a pathway for the decomposition of \frag{1,3}{A}{+} at high activation energies was proposed for the first time in this work and is universal for all studied compounds.
A signal \mz{91}, stemming from the decay of the \frag{1,4}{B}{+} or \frag{1,3}{B}{+} ion, might be a hint for a \textit{para}-monohydroxylated B-ring on flavanones and flavones respectively.
Conversely, a peak \mz{89} can point in the direction of multiple substitutions on the B-ring.

In summary, the complementary nature of the studied activation methods \gls{cid} and \gls{hcd} provides more thourough data for the study of flavonoids.
Key ions might only present themselves in the spectra of either method, and together with differences and similarities in the \gls{msms} spectra, can be used to gain additional insights into the structural characteristics of a studied compound.


%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item unmethylated compounds give better fragmentation (CID)
%% \item HCD better for methylated flavonoids
%% \item cinnamic acids: eV makes no difference (30 and 40 eV) give the same spectra
%% \item cinnamic acids: dimethylcaffeic acid and isoferulic acid methyl ester differ in retention time (methyl ester is less polar and elutes later), fragmentation: meoh cleavage of ifa-mester, h2o cleavage of dimethylcaffeic acid
%% \item cinnamic acid: methyl esters do not ionize well in neg. mode
%% \item HCD: flavanes \textrightarrow mainly fragmentation first (e.g. \frag{1,2}{A}{+}, \frag{1,4}{B}{+}), then cleavages off the fragments ((\frag{1,3}{B}{+}-CO-CH3OH))
%% \item HCD: flavones \textrightarrow higher energy (100 eV) increases ring fragmentation (main fragment \frag{1,3}{A}{+}), lower energy tends to show losses off [M+H]+ (e.g. [M+H-CH3]\textsuperscript{*+}, [M+H-CH3-CO]\textsuperscript{*+})
%% \item HCD: flavonols \textrightarrow mainly losses off the [M+H]+ (e.g. [M+H-CH4]+, [M+H-CH3OH]+, etc.)
%% \item most informative collision energy 30 eV \cite{Cuyckens2004}
%% \item \frag{1,3}{A}{+} is usually most abundant and most readily formed \cite{Cuyckens2004} \textrightarrow originates from acetateâmalonate pathway, therefore m/z 153; when 4-keto is missing e.g. flavanes flavanols m/z 139
%% \item losses of small molecules and radicals common from [M+H]+; methyl ethers usually by loss of 15 u (CH3*) \cite{Cuyckens2004} \textrightarrow  not flavones!, there loss of water (18 u) or oxa-cyclopropene (C2H2O)
%% \item[\textrightarrow] when methoxy substituent, the dominant ion is [M+H-CH3]\textsuperscript{+$\cdot$} \cite{Wolfender2000, Ma1997} (also in neg. mode \cite{Cuyckens2004}) \textrightarrow not for flavones
%% \item ONLY methylated flavones and flavonoles (kaempferide, isorhamnetin, acacetin, chrysoeriol,diosmetin) show loss of m/z 44.02622 under HCD conditions (more in 100eV energy mode) \textrightarrow subsequent loss of CH4 and CO 
%%   \item \mz{170} (C7H6O5) fragment in HCD spectra of methylated flavonols and flavones and myricetin
%% \item flavones and flavonoles (kaempferide, isorhamnetin, myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol,luteolin, apigenin) also show loss of m/z 29.00274 \textrightarrow CHO? formyl radical?

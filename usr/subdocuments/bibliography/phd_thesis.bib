For such a rotation, the rotation function R = \~{} [IFhl\~{}\{\~{} IFpl\~{}G\}] h p has a maximum value. G is an interference function which has large values only when the point p in reciprocal space is brought close to h by the rotation.

This assay is very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process virtually complete in approximately 2 min with good color stability for 1 hr. There is little or no interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates such as sucrose. A small amount of color is developed in the presence of strongly alkaline buffering agents, but the assay may be run accurately by the use of proper buffer controls. The only components found to give excessive interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and commercial glassware detergents. Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of proper controls.},

This species exists in rapid equilibrium with the radical cation. The radical was observed by ESR spectroscopy, and hyperfine splitting constants were determined. Addition of equimolar hydrogen peroxide yields the yellow diimine, which is stable at acid pH. At less than equimolar peroxide, all four species (diamine, radical cation, charge-transfer complex, and diimine) exist in equilibrium. A theoretical analysis of this redox system is presented, including a determination of the extinction coefficients and equilibrium constant for the nonradical species.},

This paper describes a cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for separating (S,S)-AdoMet from the biologically inactive (R,S)-AdoMet that results from racemization at the sulfur. This method was used to measure the rates of the degradation reactions of (S,S)-AdoMet as a function of pH. These reactions and the first-order rate constants, which were found at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5, are racemization, 1.8 X 10(-6) s-1; cleavage to homoserine lactone and 5'-(methylthio)adenosine, 4.6 X 10(-6) s-1; and hydrolysis to adenine and S-pentosylmethionine, 3 X 10(-6) s-1. Racemization showed no change in rate over the pH range from 7.5 to 1.5. The cleavage reaction persisted until the pH was lowered to 1.5, but hydrolysis ceased at pH 6. Commercial samples of nonradioactive AdoMet contained 20-30\% (R,S)-AdoMet, while a sample of [methyl-3H]AdoMet had less than 1\% (R,S)-AdoMet. Preparing enzyme substrates by mixing such samples will cause an underestimate of specific activity and an overestimate of the amount of product. The (R,S)-AdoMet/(S,S)-AdoMet ratio in mouse liver was 0.03, much less than the value of 0.19 calculated from the above rate constants. An enzyme extract from mouse liver did not degrade (R,S)-AdoMet, but a more thorough search may find such an activity. In any event, the cleavage and hydrolysis reactions partially balance the racemization of (S,S)-AdoMet in vivo and prevent excessive accumulation of (R,S)-AdoMet.},

abstract = {Quantitative study of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions in solution requires accurate determination of protein concentration. Often, for proteins available only in "molecular biological" amounts, it is difficult or impossible to make an accurate experimental measurement of the molar extinction coefficient of the protein. Yet without a reliable value of this parameter, one cannot determine protein concentrations by the usual uv spectroscopic means. Fortunately, knowledge of amino acid residue sequence and promoter molecular weight (and thus also of amino acid composition) is generally available through the DNA sequence, which is usually accurately known for most such proteins. In this paper we present a method for calculating accurate (to +/- 5\% in most cases) molar extinction coefficients for proteins at 280 nm, simply from knowledge of the amino acid composition. The method is calibrated against 18 "normal" globular proteins whose molar extinction coefficients are accurately known, and the assumptions underlying the method, as well as its limitations, are discussed.},

Insufficient availability of cobalamin, or inhibition of methionine synthase by exposure to nitrous oxide, leads to diminished activity of this enzyme. In humans, severe inhibition of methionine synthase results in the development of megaloblastic anemia, and eventually in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. It also results in diminished intracellular folate levels and a redistribution of folate derivatives. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding the catalysis and regulation of this important enzyme from both bacterial and mammalian sources. Because inhibition of mammalian methionine synthase can restrict the incorporation of methyltetrahydrofolate from the blood into cellular folate pools that can be used for nucleotide biosynthesis, it is a potential chemotherapeutic target. The review emphasizes the mechanistic information that will be needed in order to design rational inhibitors of the enzyme.},

The utility of QSARs for biodegradation has been evaluated in the light of various physicochemical, quantum, and molecular descriptors and biodegradation parameters. It has been suggested that further development of successful QSARs for biodegradation should involve the establishment of large and consistent biodegradation data bases and the identification descriptors that can relate well to the mechanisms and rate limiting processes in the biodegradation sequence. Among the descriptors studied, the quantum chemical‐type descriptors appear to be most promising for the development of QSARs for the prediction of biodegradability of environmental pollutants.},

abstract = {The kinetic mechanism of the rod outer segment (ROS) isoprenylated protein methyltransferase was investigated. This S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-linked enzyme transfers methyl groups to carboxyl-terminal isoprenylated cysteine residues of proteins, generating methyl esters. The enzyme also processes simple substrates such as N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine (L-AFC). Initial studies showed that a ping-pong Bi Bi mechanism could be eliminated. In a ping-pong Bi Bi mechanism plots of 1/v versus 1/[substrate A] at different fixed substrate B concentrations are expected to yield a family of parallel lines whose slopes equal Km/Vmax. In fact, converging curves were found, which suggested a sequential mechanism. Dead-end inhibitors were used in order to further investigate the kinetic mechanism. S-Farnesylthioacetic acid is shown to be a dead-end competitive inhibitor with respect to the prenylated substrate L-AFC. On the other hand, S-farnesylthioacetic acid proved to be uncompetitive with respect to AdoMet, suggesting an ordered mechanism with AdoMet binding first. Further evidence for this mechanism came from product inhibition studies using the methyl ester of L-AFC (L-AFCMe) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy). Since AdoMet binds first to the enzyme, one of the products (L-AFCMe or AdoHcy) should be a competitive inhibitor with respect to it. It could be shown that AdoHcy is a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet, but L-AFCMe is a mixed-type inhibitor both with respect to AdoMet and to L-AFC. Therefore, AdoHcy combines with the same enzyme form as does AdoMet, and must be released from the enzyme last. Moreover, L-AFC and L-AFCMe must bind to different forms of the enzyme.},

The PCR-amplified CA4H open reading frame was inserted into pYeDP60 under the transcriptional control of a galactose-inducible artificial promoter. Engineered S. cerevisiae strains producing human P450 reductase or normal or overproduced amounts of yeast P450 reductase were transformed to express recombinant CA4H. When grown on galactose, yeast cells produced CA4H holoprotein bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as judged from the reduced iron/carbon monoxide difference spectrum centered at 452 nm and from typical cinnamate 4-hydroxylase activity upon coupling with the different P450 reductases and NADPH. Some CA4H protein was found also addressed to the yeast mitochondria but as a low-activity form. The spectral and kinetic characterizations of the yeast-produced CA4H in different redox protein environments are presented using both assays on yeast microsomal fractions and bioconversions on living cells. Results indicate that the microsomal system constituted by the overexpressed yeast P450 reductase and CA4H is characterized by a 1:1 coupling between NADPH oxidation and cinnamate hydroxylation and by one of the highest turnover numbers reported for an NADPH-dependent P450 reaction. Based on spectral perturbation and inhibition studies, coumarate appeared to have no detectable affinity for the enzyme. A possible geometry of the substrate recognition pocket is discussed in the light of these data.},

With selective inhibitors of COMT in combination with L-DOPA, a new principle has been realized in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. Here we solve the atomic structure of COMT to 2.0 A resolution, which provides new insights into the mechanism of the methyl transfer reaction. The co-enzyme-binding domain is strikingly similar to that of an AdoMet-dependent DNA methylase, indicating that all AdoMet methylases may have a common structure.},

The DNA is located in a cleft between the two domains of the protein and has the characteristic conformation of B-form DNA, except for a disrupted G-C base pair that contains the target cytosine. The cytosine residue has swung completely out of the DNA helix and is positioned in the active site, which itself has undergone a large conformational change. The DNA is contacted from both the major and the minor grooves, but almost all base-specific interactions between the enzyme and the recognition bases occur in the major groove, through two glycine-rich loops from the small domain.

abstract = {Enthalpy-entropy compensations are a consequence of weak associations where the binding enthalpy is much lower than typical covalent bond strengths. The general form of an enthalpy-entropy curve is presented based upon theoretical considerations and justified on the basis of experimental data for associations in the gas phase and for monatomic sublimation. The intrinsic curvature of the enthalpy . entropy plot provides the basis for a description of co-operativity and binding phenomena in solution. In the case of cooperativity, we divide the mutual aiding of two interactions into two distinct parts, one of which is entropic in origin and related to the classical chelate enhancement of binding of Jencks; the other is an enthalpic benefit due to improved electrostatic bonding. Since the experimental Gibbs energy for all weak associations in solution is a consequence of competing solute-solvent, solvent-solvent and solute-solute interactions, the summation of these interactions can be usefully described by a vector analysis using the enthalpy-entropy curve. We illustrate the utility of this approach by presenting a qualitative description of the various contributions to binding in the following examples: () one-point associations in non-polar solvents, () entropy-driven association of two large discs involving the release of multiple solvent molecules and () enthalpy driven associations involving metal chelation by polyamines. By considering the curvature of the enthalpy-entropy plot for a given interaction, in combination with the possibility of making or breaking multiple interactions on one template, net enthalpies and entropies of association in solution can be explored in an approximate manner.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In both mammalian and microbial species, B12-dependent methionine synthase catalyzes methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) to homocysteine. The B12 (cobalamin) cofactor plays an essential role in this reaction, accepting the methyl group from CH3-H4folate to form methylcob(III)alamin and in turn donating the methyl group to homocysteine to generate methionine and cob(I)alamin. Occasionally the highly reactive cob(I)alamin intermediate is oxidized to the catalytically inactive cob(II)alamin form. Reactivation to sustain enzyme activity is achieved by a reductive methylation, requiring S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor and, in Esherichia coli, flavodoxin as an electron donor. The intact system is controlled and organized so that AdoMet, rather than methyltetrahydrofolate, is the methyl donor in the reactivation reaction. AdoMet is not wasted as a methyl donor in the catalytic cycle in which methionine is synthesized from homocysteine. The structures of the AdoMet binding site and the cobalamin-binding domains (previously determined) provide a starting point for understanding the methyl transfer reactions of methionine synthase. RESULTS: We report the crystal structure of the 38 kDa C-terminal fragment of E.coli methionine synthase that comprises the AdoMet-binding site and is essential for reactivation. The structure, which includes residues 901-1227 of methionine synthase, is a C-shaped single domain whose central feature is a bent antiparallel betasheet. Database searches indicate that the observed polypeptide has no close relatives. AdoMet binds near the center of the inner surface of the domain and is held in place by both side chain and backbone interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The conformation of bound AdoMet, and the interactions that determine its binding, differ from those found in other AdoMet-dependent enzymes. The sequence Arg-x-x-x-Gly-Tyr is critical for the binding of AdoMet to methionine synthase. The position of bound AdoMet suggests that large areas of the C-terminal and cobalamin-binding fragments must come in contact in order to transfer the methyl group of AdoMet to cobalamin. The catalytic and activation cycles may be turned off and on by alternating physical separation and approach of the reactants.},

abstract = {The antioxidant and prooxidant behavior of flavonoids and the related activity-structure relationships were investigated in this study using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay. Three different reactive species were used in the assay: 2,2′-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride, a peroxyl radical generator; Cu2+-H2O2, mainly a hydroxyl radical generator; and Cu2+, a transition metal. Flavonoids including flavones, isoflavones, and flavanones acted as antioxidants against peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals and served as prooxidants in the presence of Cu2+. Both the antioxidant and the copper-initiated prooxidant activities of a flavonoid depend upon the number of hydroxyl substitutions in its backbone structure, which has neither antioxidant nor prooxidant action. In general, the more hydroxyl substitutions, the stronger the antioxidant and prooxidant activities. The flavonoids that contain multiple hydroxyl substitutions showed antiperoxyl radical activities several times stronger than Trolox, an $\alpha$-tocopherol analogue. The single hydroxyl substitution at position 5 provides no activity, whereas the di-OH substitution at 3′ and 4′ is particularly important to the peroxyl radical absorbing activity of a flavonoid. The conjugation between rings A and B does not affect the antioxidant activity but is very important for the copper-initiated prooxidant action of a flavonoid. The O-methylation of the hydroxyl substitutions inactivates both the antioxidant and the prooxidant activities of the flavonoids.Copyright © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

The location of AdoHcy and a number of conserved residues, helps define the precorrin binding site.

To date, genes or cDNAs encoding at least ten distinct groups of SAM-Mtases that utilize SAM and a variety of substrates have been reported from higher plants. Three amino acid sequence motifs are conserved in most of these SAM-Mtases. In addition, many conserved domains have been discovered in each group of O-methyltransferases (OMTs) that methylate specific substrates and may act as sites for substrate specificity in each enzyme. Finally, a diagrammatic representation of the relationship between different OMTs is presented. These SAM-Mtase sequence signatures will be useful in the identification of SAM-Mtase motifs in the hitherto unidentified proteins as well as for designing primers in the isolation of new SAM-Mtases from plants.},

abstract = {In the last ten years, there has been an important increase in interest in quercetin action as a unique antioxidant, but its putative role in numerous prooxidant effects is also being continually updated. The mechanism underlying this undesirable ability seems to involve its metabolic oxidoreductive activation. Based on the structural properties of quercetin, we have investigated whether its catechol moiety may be the potential tool for revealed toxicity. We demonstrated, with an ESR spin-stabilization technique coupled to conventional spectrophotometry, that o-semiquinone and o-quinone are indeed the products of enzymatically catalyzed oxidative degradation of quercetin. The former radical might serve to facilitate the formation of superoxide and depletion of GSH, which could confer a specificity of its prooxidative action in situ. The observed one-electron reduction of o-quinone may enrich the semiquinone pool, thereby magnifying its effect. The two-electron reduction of quinone can result in constant resupply of quercetin in situ, thereby also modulating another pathway of its known biological activities. We have also tried to see whether the intracellular oxidative degradation of quercetin can be confirmed under the controlled conditions of model monolayer cell cultures. The results are indicative of the intracellular metabolic activation of quercetin to o-quinone, the process which can be partially associated with the observed concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect of quercetin.},

It produces chalcone by condensing one p-coumaroyl- and three malonyl-coenzyme A thioesters into a polyketide reaction intermediate that cyclizes. The crystal structures of CHS alone and complexed with substrate and product analogs reveal the active site architecture that defines the sequence and chemistry of multiple decarboxylation and condensation reactions and provides a molecular understanding of the cyclization reaction leading to chalcone synthesis. The structure of CHS complexed with resveratrol also suggests how stilbene synthase, a related enzyme, uses the same substrates and an alternate cyclization pathway to form resveratrol. By using the three-dimensional structure and the large database of CHS-like sequences, we can identify proteins likely to possess novel substrate and product specificity. The structure elucidates the chemical basis of plant polyketide biosynthesis and provides a framework for engineering CHS-like enzymes to produce new products.},

The enzyme catalyzes methylation of lambda-DNA, a 50-kilobase pair linear molecule with multiple M.MspI-specific sites, with a specificity constant (kcat/KM) of 0.9 x 10(8) M-1 s-1. But the values of the specificity constants for the smaller DNA substrates (121 and 1459 base pairs (bp)) with single methylation target or with multiple targets (sonicated lambda-DNA) were less by an order of magnitude. Product inhibition of the M.MspI-catalyzed methylation reaction by methylated DNA is competitive with respect to DNA and noncompetitive with respect to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). The S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibition of the methylation reaction is competitive with respect to AdoMet and uncompetitive with respect to DNA. The presteady state kinetic analysis showed a burst of product formation when AdoMet was added to the enzyme preincubated with the substrate DNA. The burst is followed by a constant rate of product formation (0.06 mol per mol of enzyme s-1) which is similar to catalytic constants (kcat = approximately 0.056 s-1) measured under steady state conditions. The isotope exchange in chasing the labeled methyltransferase-DNA complex with unlabeled DNA and AdoMet leads to a reduced burst as compared with the one involving chase with labeled DNA and AdoMet. The enzyme is capable of exchanging tritium at C-5 of target cytosine in the substrate DNA in the absence of cofactor AdoMet. The kinetic data are consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism for the M.MspI-catalyzed DNA methylation where DNA binds first.},

For an efficient use of this technique in the dereplication of natural products, a careful study of the parameters used to generate informative MS/MS spectra is needed. In this paper the CID MS/MS spectra of ubiquitous flavonoids and related plant constituents have been systematically studied using hybrid quadrupole time of flight (Q-TOF) and ion trap (IT) mass analysers under various CID energy conditions. The results demonstrate that, if for hydroxylated flavonoids the CID MS/MS spectra generated on both instruments are similar, for partially methoxylated derivatives, important differences are observed hampering the creation of MS/MS databases exchangeable between instruments. Generally, fragments issued from C-ring cleavage, corresponding to those classically reported, were recorded but they were more easily observed on a Q-TOF instrument while losses of small molecules were favoured in IT-MS. MS/MS spectra recorded in the positive ion mode were more informative than those obtained from negative ions. For the assignment of flavonoids product ion spectra, on-line accurate mass measurement of all MS/MS fragments was obtained on the Q-TOF, while the multiple stage MSn capability of the ion trap was used to prove fragmentation pathways.},

The structure and mutational analysis suggest a mechanism in which shape complementarity of the binding cleft locks the substrate into a constrained conformation that allows the reaction to proceed with a second-order rate constant approaching the diffusion controlled limit. This structure raises questions about the evolutionary history of this structurally unique plant enzyme.},

abstract = {The vertebrate olfactory system discriminates a wide variety of odorants by relaying coded information from olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium to olfactory cortical areas of the brain. Recent studies have shown that the first step in odor discrimination is mediated by approximately 1000 distinct olfactory receptors, which comprise the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, we used Ca(2+) imaging and single-cell reverse transcription-PCR techniques to identify mouse olfactory neurons responding to an odorant and subsequently to clone a receptor gene from the responsive cell. The functionally cloned receptors were expressed in heterologous systems, demonstrating that structurally related olfactory receptors recognized overlapping sets of odorants with distinct affinities and specificities. Our results provide direct evidence for the existence of a receptor code in which the identities of different odorants are specified by distinct combinations of odorant receptors that possess unique molecular receptive ranges. We further demonstrate that the receptor code for an odorant changes with odorant concentration. Finally, we show that odorant receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells couple to stimulatory G-proteins such as Galphaolf, resulting in odorant-dependent increases in cAMP. Odor discrimination is thus determined by differences in the receptive ranges of the odorant receptors that together encode specific odorant molecules.},

abstract = {Eleven naturally occurring flavonoid aglycones, belonging to the representative flavone, flavonol, and flavanone types were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed on-line with negative ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). In order to resolve the MS/MS spectra obtained, each compound was reinvestigated by direct loop injections using an ion trap mass spectrometer. The MSn spectra obtained allowed us to propose plausible schemes for their fragmentation supported by the analysis of five complementary synthetic flavonoid aglycones. The negative ion ESI-MS/MS behavior of the different aglycones investigated in this study revealed interesting differences when compared with the previously described patterns obtained using various ionization techniques in positive ion. Thus, concerning the retro Diels-Alder (RDA) fragmentation pathways, several structurally informative anions appeared highly specific of the negative ion mode. In addition, a new lactone-type structure, instead of a ketene, was proposed for a classic RDA diagnostic ion. We also observed unusual CO, CO2, and C3O2 losses which appear to be characteristic of the negative ion mode. All these results and these unusual neutral losses show that the negative ion mode was a powerful complementary tool of the positive ion mode for the structural characterization of flavonoid aglycones by ESI-MS/MS.

Recent work has revealed how DNA methylation and chromatin structure are linked at the molecular level and how methylation anomalies play a direct causal role in tumorigenesis and genetic disease. Much new information has also come to light regarding the cellular methylation machinery, known as the DNA methyltransferases, in terms of their roles in mammalian development and the types of proteins they are known to interact with. This information has forced a new view for the role of DNA methyltransferases. Rather than enzymes that act in isolation to copy methylation patterns after replication, the types of interactions discovered thus far indicate that DNA methyltransferases may be components of larger complexes actively involved in transcriptional control and chromatin structure modulation. These new findings will likely enhance our understanding of the myriad roles of DNA methylation in disease as well as point the way to novel therapies to prevent or repair these defects.},

abstract = {The molecular-replacement method works well with good models and simple unit cells, but often fails with more difficult problems. Experience with likelihood in other areas of crystallography suggests that it would improve performance significantly. For molecular replacement, the form of the required likelihood function depends on whether there is ambiguity in the relative phases of the contributions from symmetry-related molecules (e.g. rotation versus translation searches). Likelihood functions used in structure refinement are appropriate only for translation (or six-dimensional) searches, where the correct translation will place all of the atoms in the model approximately correctly. A new likelihood function that allows for unknown relative phases is suitable for rotation searches. It is shown that correlations between sequence identity and coordinate error can be used to calibrate parameters for model quality in the likelihood functions. Multiple models of a molecule can be combined in a statistically valid way by setting up the joint probability distribution of the true and model structure factors as a multivariate complex normal distribution, from which the conditional distribution of the true structure factor given the models can be derived. Tests in a new molecular-replacement program, Beast, show that the likelihood-based targets are more sensitive and more accurate than previous targets. The new multiple-model likelihood function has a dramatic impact on success.},

Experimental and commercial olive oil waste waters from four Mediterranean countries were analyzed for a possible recovering of these biologically interesting constituents. Identification and quantitation of the main polyphenols were carried out by applying HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods. Representative samples of ripe olives were also analyzed at the same time to correlate, if possible, their polyphenolic profiles with those of the corresponding olive oil waste waters. The results demonstrate that Italian commercial olive oil waste waters were the richest in total polyphenolic compounds with amounts between 150 and 400 mg/100 mL of waste waters. These raw, as yet unused, matrices could represent an interesting and alternative source of biologically active polyphenols.},

abstract = {Caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid 3/5- O -methyltransferase (COMT) from alfalfa is an S -adenosyl- L -Met–dependent O -methyltransferase involved in lignin biosynthesis. COMT methylates caffeoyl- and 5-hydroxyferuloyl–containing acids, aldehydes, and alcohols in vitro while displaying a kinetic preference for the alcohols and aldehydes over the free ac- ids. The 2.2-\AA crystal structure of COMT in complex with S -adenosyl- L -homocysteine (SAH) and ferulic acid (ferulate form), as well as the 2.4-\AA crystal structure of COMT in complex with SAH and 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde, provide a structural understanding of the observed substrate preferences. These crystal structures identify residues lining the active site surface that contact the substrates. Structurally guided site-directed mutagenesis of active site residues was performed with the goal of altering the kinetic preferences for physiological substrates. The kinetic parameters of the COMT mutants versus wild-type enzyme are presented, and coupled with the high-resolution crystal structures, they will serve as a starting point for the in vivo manipulation of lignin monomers in transgenic plants. Ultimately, this structurally based approach to metabolic engineering will allow the further alteration of the lignin biosynthetic pathway in agronomically important plants. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the in vivo operation of the po- tential metabolic grid for monolignol biosynthesis.},

Although in many cases ionic liquids have simply been used to replace organic solvents, they have often led to improved process performance. Unlike conventional organic solvents, ionic liquids possess no vapor pressure, are able to dissolve many compounds, and can be used to form two-phase systems with many solvents. To date, reactions involving lipases have benefited most from the use of ionic liquids, but the use of ionic liquids with other enzymes and in whole-cell processes has also been described. In some cases, remarkable results with respect to yield, (enantio)selectivity or enzyme stability were observed.},

abstract = {Acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation of the amino-terminal tails of histones are thought to be involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. With just one exception, the enzymes identified in the methylation of specific lysine residues on histones (histone methyltransferases) belong to the SET family. The high-resolution crystal structure of a ternary complex of human SET7/9 with a histone peptide and cofactor reveals that the peptide substrate and cofactor bind on opposite surfaces of the enzyme. The target lysine accesses the active site of the enzyme and the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) cofactor by inserting its side chain into a narrow channel that runs through the enzyme, connecting the two surfaces. Here we show from the structure and from solution studies that SET7/9, unlike most other SET proteins, is exclusively a mono-methylase. The structure indicates the molecular basis of the specificity of the enzyme for the histone target, and allows us to propose a model for the methylation reaction that accounts for the role of many of the residues that are invariant across the SET family.},

abstract = {This work shows that quantitative multivariate modeling is an emerging possibility for unraveling protein-protein interactions using a combination of designed mutations with sequence and structure information. Using this approach, it is possible to stereochemically determine which residue properties contribute most to the interaction. This is illustrated by results from modeling of the interaction of the wild-type and 17 single and double mutants of a camel antibody specific for lysozyme. Linear multivariate models describing association and dissociation rates as well as affinity were developed. Sequence information in the form of amino acid property scales was combined with 3D structure information (obtained using molecular mechanics calculations) in the form of coordinates of the alpha-carbons and the center of the side chains. The results show that in addition to the amino acid properties of the mutated residues 101 and 105, the dissociation rate is controlled by the side-chain coordinate of residue 105, whereas the association is determined by the coordinates of residues 99, 100, 105 (side chain), 111, and 112. The great difference between the models for association and dissociation rates illustrates that the event of molecular recognition and the property of binding stability rely on different physical processes.},

The time frame has been extended in both directions to include the 22 years from 1981 to 2002, and a new secondary subdivision related to the natural product source but applied to formally synthetic compounds has been introduced, using the concept of a "natural product mimic" or "NM" to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, the percentage of small molecule, new chemical entities that are nonsynthetic has remained at 62\% averaged over the whole time frame. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, particularly in the antihypertensive area, where of the 74 formally synthetic drugs, 48 can be traced to natural product structures/mimics. Similarly, with the 10 antimigraine drugs, seven are based on the serotonin molecule or derivatives thereof. Finally, although combinatorial techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact, been used in the optimization of a number of recently approved agents, we have not been able to identify a de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this time frame.},

abstract = {Upon irradiation with elevated light intensities, the ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) accumulates a complex pattern of methylated and glycosylated flavonol conjugates in the upper epidermal layer. Identification of a flavonol methylating activity, partial purification of the enzyme, and sequencing of the corresponding peptide fragments revealed a novel S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that was specific for flavonoids and caffeoyl-CoA. Cloning and functional expression of the corresponding cDNA verified that the new methyltransferase is a multifunctional 26.6-kDa Mg(2+)-dependent enzyme, which shows a significant sequence similarity to the cluster of caffeoyl coenzyme A-methylating enzymes. Functional analysis of highly homologous members from chickweed (Stellaria longipes), Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) demonstrated that the enzymes from the ice plant, chickweed, and A. thaliana possess a broader substrate specificity toward o-hydroquinone-like structures than previously anticipated for Mg(2+)-dependent O-methyltransferases, and are distinctly different from the tobacco enzyme. Besides caffeoyl-CoA and flavonols, a high specificity was also observed for caffeoylglucose, a compound never before reported to be methylated by any plant O-methyltransferase. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence and differences in acceptor specificities among both animal and plant O-methyltransferases, we propose that the enzymes from the Centrospermae, along with the predicted gene product from A. thaliana, form a novel subclass within the caffeoyl coenzyme A-dependent O-methyltransferases, with potential divergent functions not restricted to lignin monomer biosynthesis.},

abstract = {'Radical SAM' enzymes generate catalytic radicals by combining a 4Fe-4S cluster and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in close proximity. We present the first crystal structure of a Radical SAM enzyme, that of HemN, the Escherichia coli oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, at 2.07 A resolution. HemN catalyzes the essential conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX during heme biosynthesis. HemN binds a 4Fe-4S cluster through three cysteine residues conserved in all Radical SAM enzymes. A juxtaposed SAM coordinates the fourth Fe ion through its amide nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen. The SAM sulfonium sulfur is near both the Fe (3.5 A) and a neighboring sulfur of the cluster (3.6 A), allowing single electron transfer from the 4Fe-4S cluster to the SAM sulfonium. SAM is cleaved yielding a highly oxidizing 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. HemN, strikingly, binds a second SAM immediately adjacent to the first. It may thus successively catalyze two propionate decarboxylations. The structure of HemN reveals the cofactor geometry required for Radical SAM catalysis and sets the stage for the development of inhibitors with antibacterial function due to the uniquely bacterial occurrence of the enzyme.},

These preliminary conditions are then optimized to produce (in a perfect world) well diffracting crystals; this process of optimization often involves fine grid screening around the initial conditions. An issue in optimization is to find factors which are independent, so as to simplify the analysis of the results of optimization trials.

Multi-buffer systems for pH modulation are presented which enable a broad pH range to be sampled without changing the chemical composition of the buffering component.},

abstract = {One of the main stumbling blocks encountered when attempting to express foreign proteins in Escherichia coli is the occurrence of amorphous aggregates of misfolded proteins, called inclusion bodies (IB). Developing efficient protein native structure recovery procedures based on IB refolding is therefore an important challenge. Unfortunately, there is no "universal" refolding buffer: Experience shows that refolding buffer composition varies from one protein to another. In addition, the methods developed so far for finding a suitable refolding buffer suffer from a number of weaknesses. These include the small number of refolding formulations, which often leads to negative results, solubility assays incompatible with high-throughput, and experiment formatting not suitable for automation. To overcome these problems, it was proposed in the present study to address some of these limitations. This resulted in the first completely automated IB refolding screening procedure to be developed using a 96-well format. The 96 refolding buffers were obtained using a fractional factorial approach. The screening procedure is potentially applicable to any nonmembrane protein, and was validated with 24 proteins in the framework of two Structural Genomics projects. The tests used for this purpose included the use of quality control methods such as circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and crystallogenesis. Out of the 24 proteins, 17 remained soluble in at least one of the 96 refolding buffers, 15 passed large-scale purification tests, and five gave crystals.},

Differences in regiospecificity as well as altered kinetic properties of the recombinant as compared to the native plant O-methyltransferase can be attributed to differences in the N-terminal part of the protein. Upon cleavage of the first 11 amino acids, the recombinant protein displays essentially the same substrate specificity as observed earlier for the native plant enzyme. Product formation of the newly designed, truncated recombinant enzyme is consistent with light-induced accumulation of methylated flavonoid conjugates in the ice plant.

abstract = {Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) flavonoids have a simple methylation pattern. Characteristic are B-ring 5′ and 3′ methylations and a methylation in the position 7 of the A-ring. The first two can be explained by a previously identified unusual O-methyltransferase (CrOMT2) that performs two sequential methylations. We used a homology based RT-PCR strategy to search for cDNAs encoding the enzyme for the A-ring 7 position. Full-length cDNAs for three proteins were characterized (CrOMT5, CrOMT6, CrOMT7). The deduced polypeptides shared 59-66\% identity among each other, with CrOMT2, and with CrOMT4 (a previously characterized protein of unknown function). The five proteins formed a cluster separate from all other OMTs in a relationship tree. Analysis of the genes showed that all C. roseus OMTs had a single intron in a conserved position, and a survey of OMT genes in other plants revealed that this intron was highly conserved in evolution. The three cDNAs were cloned for expression of His-tagged recombinant proteins. CrOMT5 was insoluble, but CrOMT6 and CrOMT7 could be purified by affinity chromatography. CrOMT7 was inactive with all compounds tested. The only substrates found for CrOMT6 were 3′-O-methyl-eriodictyol (homoeriodictyol) and the corresponding flavones and flavonols. The mass spectrometric analysis showed that the enzyme was not the expected 7OMT, but a B-ring 4′OMT. OMTs with this specificity had not been described before, and 3′,4′- dimethylated flavonoids had not been found so far in C. roseus, but they are well-known from other plants. The identification of this enzyme activity raised the question whether methylation could be a part of the mechanisms channeling flavonoid biosynthesis. We investigated four purified recombinant 2-oxoglutarate-dependent flavonoid dioxygenases: flavanone 3\ss-hydroxylase, flavone synthase, flavonol synthase, and anthocyanidin synthase. 3′-O-Methyl-eriodictyol was a substrate for all four enzymes. The activities were only slightly lower than with the standard substrate naringenin, and in some cases much higher than with eriodictyol. Methylation in the A-ring, however, strongly reduced or abolished the activities with all four enzymes. The results suggested that B-ring 3′ methylation is no hindrance for flavonoid dioxygenases. These results characterized a new type of flavonoid O-methyltransferase, and also provided new insights into the catalytic capacities of key dioxygenases in flavonoid biosynthesis. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This tutorial presents the most common ion activation techniques employed in tandem mass spectrometry. In-source fragmentation and metastable ion decompositions, as well as the general theory of unimolecular dissociations of ions, are initially discussed. This is followed by tandem mass spectrometry, which implies that the activation of ions is distinct from the ionization step, and that the precursor and product ions are both characterized independently by their mass/charge ratios. In collision-induced dissociation (CID), activation of the selected ions occurs by collision(s) with neutral gas molecules in a collision cell. This experiment can be done at high (keV) collision energies, using tandem sector and time-of-flight instruments, or at low (eV range) energies, in tandem quadrupole and ion trapping instruments. It can be performed using either single or multiple collisions with a selected gas and each of these factors influences the distribution of internal energy that the activated ion will possess. While CID remains the most common ion activation technique employed in analytical laboratories today, several new methods have become increasingly useful for specific applications. More recent techniques are examined and their differences, advantages and disadvantages are described in comparison with CID. Collisional activation upon impact of precursor ions on solid surfaces, surface-induced dissociation (SID), is gaining importance as an alternative to gas targets and has been implemented in several different types of mass spectrometers. Furthermore, unique fragmentation mechanisms of multiply-charged species can be studied by electron-capture dissociation (ECD). The ECD technique has been recognized as an efficient means to study non-covalent interactions and to gain sequence information in proteomics applications. Trapping instruments, such as quadrupole ion traps and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance instruments, are particularly useful for the photoactivation of ions, specifically for fragmentation of precursor ions by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD). IRMPD is a non-selective activation method and usually yields rich fragmentation spectra. Lastly, blackbody infrared radiative dissociation is presented with a focus on determining activation energies and other important parameters for the characterization of fragmentation pathways. The individual methods are presented so as to facilitate the understanding of each mechanism of activation and their particular advantages and representative applications.},

Differences in regiospecificity as well as altered kinetic properties of the recombinant as compared to the native plant O-methyltransferase can be attributed to differences in the N-terminal part of the protein. Upon cleavage of the first 11 amino acids, the recombinant protein displays essentially the same substrate specificity as observed earlier for the native plant enzyme. Product formation of the newly designed, truncated recombinant enzyme is consistent with light-induced accumulation of methylated flavonoid conjugates in the ice plant. Therefore, substrate affinity and regiospecificity of an O-methyltransferase in vivo and in vitro can be controlled by cleavage of an N-terminal domain. ?? 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Mass spectrometry can make an invaluable contribution because of its high sensitivity, possibilities of coupling with liquid chromatography and the availability of powerful tandem mass spectrometric techniques. A review of currently available mass spectrometric methodology used in the structure elucidation of flavonoids is presented.

abstract = {Recombinant proteins are often expressed in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies in bacteria. To facilitate refolding of recombinant proteins obtained from inclusion bodies, 0.1 to 1 M arginine is customarily included in solvents used for refolding the proteins by dialysis or dilution. In addition, arginine at higher concentrations, e.g., 0.5-2 M, can be used to extract active, folded proteins from insoluble pellets obtained after lysing Escherichia coli cells. Moreover, arginine increases the yield of proteins secreted to the periplasm, enhances elution of antibodies from Protein-A columns, and stabilizes proteins during storage. All these arginine effects are apparently due to suppression of protein aggregation. Little is known, however, about the mechanism. Various effects of solvent additives on proteins have been attributed to their preferential interaction with the protein, effects on surface tension, or effects on amino acid solubility. The suppression of protein aggregation by arginine cannot be readily explained by either surface tension effects or preferential interactions. In this review we show that interactions between the guanidinium group of arginine and tryptophan side chains may be responsible for suppression of protein aggregation by arginine.},

abstract = {A recurring obstacle for structural genomics is the expression of insoluble, aggregated proteins. In these cases, the use of alternative salvage strategies, like in vitro refolding, is hindered by the lack of a universal refolding method. To overcome this obstacle, fractional factorial screens have been introduced as a systematic and rapid method to identify refolding conditions. However, methodical analyses of the effectiveness of refolding reagents on large sets of proteins remain limited. In this study, we address this void by designing a fractional factorial screen to rapidly explore the effect of 14 different reagents on the refolding of 33 structurally and functionally diverse proteins. The refolding data was analyzed using statistical methods to determine the effect of each refolding additive. The screen has been miniaturized for automation resulting in reduced protein requirements and increased throughput. Our results show that the choice of pH and reducing agent had the largest impact on protein refolding. Bis-mercaptoacetamide cyclohexane (BMC) and tris (2-carboxyethylphosphine) (TCEP) were superior reductants when compared to others in the screen. BMC was particularly effective in refolding disulfide-containing proteins, while TCEP was better for nondisulfide-containing proteins. From the screen, we successfully identified a positive synergistic interaction between nondetergent sulfobetaine 201 (NDSB 201) and BMC on Cdc25A refolding. The soluble protein resulting from this interaction crystallized and yielded a 2.2 Angstroms structure. Our method, which combines a fractional factorial screen with statistical analysis of the data, provides a powerful approach for the identification of optimal refolding reagents in a general refolding screen.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of human phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (hPNMT) reveals a disulfide-linked dimer, despite the presence of reducing agent in the crystallisation conditions. By removing the reducing agent, hPNMT crystals grow more rapidly and at lower protein concentrations. However, it was unclear whether the disulfide bonds are only present in the crystal form or whether these affect enzyme activity. The solution oligomeric state of hPNMT was investigated using biochemical techniques and activity assays. We found that in the absence of reducing agent, hPNMT forms dimers in solution. Furthermore, the solution dimer of hPNMT incorporates disulfide bonds, since this form is sensitive to reducing agent. The C48A and C139A mutants of hPNMT, which are incapable of forming the disulfide bond observed in the crystal structure, have a decreased propensity to form dimer in solution. Those dimers that do form are also sensitive to reducing agent. Further, the C48A/C139A double mutant shows only monomeric behaviour. Both dimeric and monomeric hPNMT, as well as mutants have wildtype enzyme activity. These results show that a variety of disulfides, including those observed in the crystal structure, can form in solution. In addition, disulfide-linked dimers are as active as the monomeric enzyme indicating that the crystal structure of the protein is a valid target for inhibitor design.

In sensory studies flavanones homoeriodictyol (1), its sodium salt (1-Na), sterubin (2), and eriodictyol (4) could significantly decrease the bitter taste of caffeine without exhibiting intrinsic strong flavors or taste characteristics. Further investigations on 1-Na elicited a broad masking activity between 10 and 40\% toward different chemical classes of bitter molecules (e.g. salicin, amarogentin, paracetamol, quinine) but not toward bitter linoleic acid emulsions. For caffeine and amarogentin, dose-response studies were performed; the masking activity toward bitter taste for both compounds reached a plateau at higher concentrations of 1-Na. Due to these facts, homoeriodictyol sodium salt (1-Na) seems to be a very interesting new taste modifier for food applications and pharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {Interactions at the binding interface of biomolecular complexes are often mediated by ordered water molecules. In this work, we considered two concanavalin A-carbohydrate complexes. In the first, a water molecule is buried at the binding interface. In the second, this water molecule is displaced by a modification of the ligand (Clarke, C.; Woods, R. J.; Gluska, J.; Cooper, A.; Nutley, M. A.; Boons, G. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 12238-12247). We computed the contribution of this water molecule to the thermodynamic properties using statistical mechanical formulas for the energy and entropy and molecular dynamics simulations. Other contributions to the binding affinity, including desolvation, entropy of conformational restriction, and interaction between the ligand and protein, were also computed. The thermodynamic consequences of displacement of the ordered water molecule by ligand modification were in qualitative agreement with experimental data. The free energy contribution of the water molecule (-17.2 kcal/mol; -19.2 enthalpic and +2 entropic) was nearly equivalent to the additional protein-ligand interactions in trimannoside 2 (-18.9 kcal/mol). The two structural ions interact more strongly with the water than with the hydroxyl of trimannoside 2, thus favoring trimannoside 1. The contributions from desolvation and conformational entropy are much smaller but significant, compared to the binding free energy difference. The picture that emerges is that the final outcome of water displacement is sensitive to the details of the binding site and cannot be predicted by simple empirical rules.},

abstract = {Inducible expression systems in which T7 RNA polymerase transcribes coding sequences cloned under control of a T7lac promoter efficiently produce a wide variety of proteins in Escherichia coli. Investigation of factors that affect stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic, unintended induction of expression in complex media, previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations. These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain plasmid and remain fully viable for weeks in the refrigerator, making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by conventional IPTG induction. Auto-inducing media have been developed for labeling proteins with selenomethionine, 15N or 13C, and for production of target proteins by arabinose induction of T7 RNA polymerase from the pBAD promoter in BL21-AI. Selenomethionine labeling was equally efficient in the commonly used methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) (found to be metE) or the prototroph BL21(DE3).},

abstract = {Flavonoids are ubiquitous in photosynthesising cells and are commonly found in fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems, flowers, tea, wine, propolis and honey. For centuries, preparations containing these compounds as the principal physiologically active constituents have been used to treat human diseases. Increasingly, this class of natural products is becoming the subject of anti-infective research, and many groups have isolated and identified the structures of flavonoids possessing antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activity. Moreover, several groups have demonstrated synergy between active flavonoids as well as between flavonoids and existing chemotherapeutics. Reports of activity in the field of antibacterial flavonoid research are widely conflicting, probably owing to inter- and intra-assay variation in susceptibility testing. However, several high-quality investigations have examined the relationship between flavonoid structure and antibacterial activity and these are in close agreement. In addition, numerous research groups have sought to elucidate the antibacterial mechanisms of action of selected flavonoids. The activity of quercetin, for example, has been at least partially attributed to inhibition of DNA gyrase. It has also been proposed that sophoraflavone G and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate inhibit cytoplasmic membrane function, and that licochalcones A and C inhibit energy metabolism. Other flavonoids whose mechanisms of action have been investigated include robinetin, myricetin, apigenin, rutin, galangin, 2,4,2′-trihydroxy-5′-methylchalcone and lonchocarpol A. These compounds represent novel leads, and future studies may allow the development of a pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial agent or class of agents.},

abstract = {Flavonoids found in plants most likely undergo a variety of modification reactions such as hydroxylation, glycosylation, and/or methylation. Among these, O-methylation has an effect on the solubility and thus on the antimicrobial activity of the flavonoids. We analyzed the conversion of naringenin with a methyltransferase, SOMT-2, from Glycine max. SOMT-2 was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathion S-transferase fusion protein. E. coli harboring SOMT-2 was grown with daidzein, geninstein, apigenin, naringenin, and quercetin, respectively, and reaction products were analyzed with thin layer chromatography and HPLC. SOMT-2 could convert apigenin, daidzein, genistein, and quercetin into the corresponding 4???-O-methylated compounds such as acacetin, formononetin, biochanine A, and 4???-methylated quercetin whereas naringenin turned out to be the best substrate tested. SOMT-2 stoichiometically converted naringenin (4???,5,7-trihyroxyflavanone) into a ponciretin (4???-methoxy-5,7-dihydroxyflavanone), whose structure was determined by NMR and LC/mass spectral analyses. Considering the reactions, SOMT-2 may have a regiospecific methylation activity, resulting in transforming 4???-hydroxyl group of flavonoids B-ring to 4???-methyl group. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Molecular replacement (MR) generally becomes more difficult as the number of components in the asymmetric unit requiring separate MR models (i.e. the dimensionality of the search) increases. When the proportion of the total scattering contributed by each search component is small, the signal in the search for each component in isolation is weak or non-existent. Maximum-likelihood MR functions enable complex asymmetric units to be built up from individual components with a ;tree search with pruning' approach. This method, as implemented in the automated search procedure of the program Phaser, has been very successful in solving many previously intractable MR problems. However, there are a number of cases in which the automated search procedure of Phaser is suboptimal or encounters difficulties. These include cases where there are a large number of copies of the same component in the asymmetric unit or where the components of the asymmetric unit have greatly varying B factors. Two case studies are presented to illustrate how Phaser can be used to best advantage in the standard ;automated MR' mode and two case studies are used to show how to modify the automated search strategy for problematic cases.},

These AdoMet analogs function as efficient cofactors for DNA methyltransferases (MTases), and we provide a protocol for sequence-specific transfer of extended side chains from these AdoMet analogs to DNA by DNA MTases. Direct chemoselective allylation or propargylation of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) at sulfur is achieved under the acidic conditions needed to protect other nucleophilic positions in AdoHcy. The unsaturated bonds in beta position to the sulfonium center of the resulting AdoMet analogs are designed to stabilize the transition state formed upon DNA MTase-catalyzed nucleophilic attack at the carbon next to the sulfonium center and lead to efficient transfer of the extended side chains to DNA. Using these protocols, sequence-specific functionalized DNA can be obtained within one to two weeks.},

abstract = {Previous studies have identified two distinct O-methyltransferases (OMTs) implicated in isoflavonoid biosynthesis in Medicago species, a 7-OMT methylating the A-ring 7-hydroxyl of the isoflavone daidzein and a 4'-OMT methylating the B-ring 4'-hydroxyl of 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone. Genes related to these OMTs from the model legume Medicago truncatula cluster as separate branches of the type I plant small molecule OMT family. To better understand the possible functions of these related OMTs in secondary metabolism in M. truncatula, seven of the OMTs were expressed in E. coli, purified, and their in vitro substrate preferences determined. Many of the enzymes display promiscuous activities, and some exhibit dual regio-specificity for the 4' and 7-hydroxyl moieties of the isoflavonoid nucleus. Protein structure homology modeling was used to help rationalize these catalytic activities. Transcripts encoding the different OMT genes exhibited differential tissue-specific and infection- or elicitor-induced expression, but not always in parallel with changes in expression of confirmed genes of the isoflavonoid pathway. The results are discussed in relation to the potential in vivo functions of these OMTs based on our current understanding of the phytochemistry of M. truncatula, and the difficulties associated with gene annotation in plant secondary metabolism.},

The recombinant TaOMT2 protein was purified to near homogeneity and tested for its substrate preference against a number of phenolic compounds.

The sequential order of tricetin methylation by TaOMT2 is envisaged to proceed via its 3???-mono- ??? 3???,5???-di- ??? 3???,4???,5???-trimethyl ether derivatives.

The results obtained demonstrate that (i) (-)-gallocatechin-3-gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, (-)-catechin-3-gallate, (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate, theaflavin-3, 3'-digallate, theaflavin-3'-gallate, and theaflavin-3-gallate showed antimicrobial activities at nanomolar levels; (ii) most compounds were more active than were medicinal antibiotics, such as tetracycline or vancomycin, at comparable concentrations; (iii) the bactericidal activities of the teas could be accounted for by the levels of catechins and theaflavins as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography; (iv) freshly prepared tea infusions were more active than day-old teas; and (v) tea catechins without gallate side chains, gallic acid and the alkaloids caffeine and theobromine also present in teas, and herbal (chamomile and peppermint) teas that contain no flavonoids are all inactive. These studies extend our knowledge about the antimicrobial effects of food ingredients.},

We report crystallographic analyses of unliganded Rhodobacter sphaeroides tyrosine ammonia-lyase (RsTAL) and RsTAL bound to p-coumarate and caffeate. His 89 of RsTAL forms a hydrogen bond with the p-hydroxyl moieties of coumarate and caffeate. His 89 is conserved in TALs but replaced in phenylalanine ammonia-lyases (PALs) and histidine ammonia-lyases (HALs). Substitution of His 89 by Phe, a characteristic residue of PALs, yields a mutant with a switch in kinetic preference from L-Tyr to L-Phe. Structures of the H89F mutant in complex with the PAL product, cinnamate, or the PAL-specific inhibitor, 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonate (AIP), support the role of position 89 as a specificity determinant in the family of aromatic amino acid ammonia-lyases and aminomutases responsible for $\beta$-amino acid biosynthesis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Metabolic conversion of inorganic arsenic into methylated products is a multistep process that yields mono-, di-, and trimethylated arsenicals. In recent years, it has become apparent that formation of methylated metabolites of inorganic arsenic is not necessarily a detoxification process. Intermediates and products formed in this pathway may be more reactive and toxic than inorganic arsenic. Like all metabolic pathways, understanding the pathway for arsenic methylation involves identification of each individual step in the process and the characterization of the molecules which participate in each step. Among several arsenic methyltransferases that have been identified, arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase is the one best characterized at the genetic and functional levels. This review focuses on phylogenetic relationships in the deuterostomal lineage for this enzyme and on the relation between genotype for arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase and phenotype for conversion of inorganic arsenic to methylated metabolites. Two conceptual models for function of arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase which posit different roles for cellular reductants in the conversion of inorganic arsenic to methylated metabolites are compared. Although each model accurately represents some aspects of enzyme’s role in the pathway for arsenic methylation, neither model is a fully satisfactory representation of all the steps in this metabolic pathway. Additional information on the structure and function of the enzyme will be needed to develop a more comprehensive model for this pathway.},

abstract = {A liquid chromatography-particle-beam mass spectrometer (LC-PB/MS) with interchangeable electron-impact (EI) and glow-discharge (GD) ion sources was evaluated for future application in analysis of botanical extracts. In this work a green tea tincture was characterized for a series of catechin components (catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) and caffeine. Special emphasis was given to EGCG and caffeine, because they are important in determining the possible health effects of the green tea. The effects of instrument operating conditions were evaluated for the EI and GD ionization sources to determine their effect on analyte intensities and fragmentation patterns. These studies furnished information about the effects of these conditions in determining possible ionization pathways in the two ion sources. The mass spectra of these compounds obtained with the GD ion source are EI-like in appearance, with clearly identified molecular ions and fragmentation patterns that are easily rationalized. The absolute limits of detection for EGCG and caffeine were, respectively, 11 ng and 0.77 ng for the EI source and 3.2 ng and 0.61 ng for the GD source. The PB/EIMS and PB/GDMS combinations can be operated in a flow-injection mode, wherein the analyte is injected directly into the mobile phase, or coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enabling LC-MS analysis of complex mixtures. A reversed-phase chromatographic separation of the green tea tincture was performed on a commercial C18 column using a gradient of water (containing 0.1\% TFA) and ACN. Quantification of EGCG and caffeine was performed by the standard addition method. The amounts of EGCG and caffeine in the tested green tea tincture were each approximately 14 mg mL-1.},

abstract = {Hydrolysis of plant biomass is achieved by the combined action of enzymes secreted by microorganisms and directed against the backbone and the side chains of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Among side chains degrading enzymes, the feruloyl esterase A (FAEA) specifically removes feruloyl residues. Thus, FAEA has potential applications in a wide range of industrial processes such as paper bleaching or bio-ethanol production. To gain insight into FAEA hydrolysis activity, we solved its crystal structure. In this paper, we report how the use of four consecutive factorial approaches (two incomplete factorials, one sparse matrix, and one full factorial) allowed expressing in Escherichia coli, refolding and then crystallizing Aspergillus niger FAEA in 6 weeks. Culture conditions providing the highest expression level were determined using an incomplete factorial approach made of 12 combinations of four E. coli strains, three culture media and three temperatures (full factorial: 36 combinations). Aspergillus niger FAEA was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. These were dissolved using a chaotropic agent, and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni column under denaturing conditions. A suitable buffer for refolding the protein eluted from the Ni column was found using a second incomplete factorial approach made of 96 buffers (full factorial: 3840 combinations). After refolding, the enzyme was further purified by gel filtration, and then crystallized following a standard protocol: initial crystallization conditions were found using commercial crystallization screens based on a sparse matrix. Crystals were then optimized using a full factorial screen. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The enzyme BchM (S-adenosyl-L-methionine:magnesium-protoporphyrin IX O-methyltransferase) from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyses an intermediate reaction in the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. Overexpression of His(6)-tagged protein in Escherichia coli resulted in the majority of polypeptide existing as inclusion bodies. Purification from inclusion bodies was performed using metal-affinity chromatography after an elaborate wash step involving surfactant polysorbate-20. Initial enzymatic assays involved an in situ generation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine substrate using a crude preparation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase and this resulted in higher enzymatic activity compared with commercial S-adenosyl-L-methionine. A heat-stable stimulatory component present in the S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase was found to be a phospholipid, which increased enzymatic activity 3-4-fold. Purified phospholipids also stabilized enzymatic activity and caused a disaggregation of the protein to lower molecular mass forms, which ranged from monomeric to multimeric species as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. There was no stimulatory effect observed with magnesium-chelatase subunits on methyltransferase activity using His-BchM that had been stabilized with phospholipids. Substrate specificity of the enzyme was limited to 5-co-ordinate square-pyramidal metalloporphyrins, with magnesium-protoporphyrin IX being the superior substrate followed by zinc-protoporphyrin IX and magnesium-deuteroporphyrin. Kinetic analysis indicated a random sequential reaction mechanism. Three non-substrate metalloporphyrins acted as inhibitors with different modes of inhibition exhibited with manganese III-protoporphyrin IX (non-competitive or uncompetitive) compared with cobalt II-protoporphyrin IX (competitive).},

abstract = {Current cloning technologies based on site-specific recombination are efficient, simple to use, and flexible, but have the drawback of leaving recombination site sequences in the final construct, adding an extra 8 to 13 amino acids to the expressed protein. We have devised a simple and rapid subcloning strategy to transfer any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence. With proper design of the cleavage sites, two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site. Based on this property, a cloning strategy called 'Golden Gate' cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation. This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct, thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation.},

The corresponding enzyme was classified as a cation- and S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase (SynOMT), consistent with considerable amino acid sequence identities to eukaryotic O-methyltransferases (OMTs). The substrate specificity of SynOMT was similar with those of plant and mammalian CCoAOMT-like proteins accepting a variety of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids as substrates. In contrast to the known mammalian and plant enzymes, which exclusively methylate the meta-hydroxyl position of aromatic di- and trihydroxy systems, Syn-OMT also methylates the para-position of hydroxycinnamic acids like 5-hydroxyferulic and 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid, resulting in the formation of novel compounds. The x-ray structure of SynOMT indicates that the active site allows for two alternative orientations of the hydroxylated substrates in comparison to the active sites of animal and plant enzymes, consistent with the observed preferred para-methylation and position promiscuity. Lys3 close to the N terminus of the recombinant protein appears to play a key role in the activity of the enzyme. The possible implications of these results with respect to modifications of precursors of polymers like lignin are discussed.},

While the primary activity of these class I enzymes is methylation of caffeoyl coenzyme A OMTs, a distinct subset is able to methylate a wider range of substrates, characterized by the promiscuous phenylpropanoid and flavonoid OMT. The observed broad substrate specificity resides in two regions: the N-terminus and a variable insertion loop near the C-terminus, which displays the lowest degree of sequence conservation between the two subfamilies.

abstract = {Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is now routinely used to directly characterize the thermodynamics of biopolymer binding interactions and the kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. This is the result of improvements in ITC instrumentation and data analysis software. Modern ITC instruments make it possible to measure heat effects as small as 0.1??cal (0.4 ??J), allowing the determination of binding constants, K's, as large as 108-109M-1. Modern ITC instruments make it possible to measure heat rates as small as 0.1??cal/sec, allowing for the precise determination of reaction rates in the range of 10-12mol/sec. Values for Km and kcat, in the ranges of 10-2-103??M and 0.05-500sec-1, respectively, can be determined by ITC. This chapter reviews the planning of an optimal ITC experiment for either a binding or kinetic study, guides the reader through simulated sample experiments, and reviews analysis of the data and the interpretation of the results. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The analyzed nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene proved to be identical to those reported on the NCBI database. The recombinant enzyme is a tetramer, showing a molecular weight of approximately 210 kDa, as estimated by gel filtration. The K(M) values of the enzyme for S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), adenosine (Ado), and homocysteine (Hcy), were determined to be 1.4, 10, and 45 microM. The overexpression of the recombinant enzyme produced a high level of protein (>40 mg of protein per gram of wet cells) and revealed certain thermostability when characterized at temperatures above 40 degrees C. It also showed a high capacity for the synthesis of SAH, thermal stability, and high kinetic similarity to human SAHase, indicating a high biotechnological and pharmacological potential.},

abstract = {Due to the increasing understanding of the health benefits and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids, there continues to be significant effort dedicated to improved analytical methods for characterizing the structures of flavonoids and monitoring their levels in fruits and vegetables, as well as developing new approaches for mapping the interactions of flavonoids with biological molecules. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), particularly in conjunction with liquid chromatography (LC), is the dominant technique that has been pursued for elucidation of flavonoids. Metal complexation strategies have proven to be especially promising for enhancing the ionization of flavonoids and yielding key diagnostic product ions for differentiation of isomers. Of particular value is the addition of a chromophoric ligand to allow the application of infrared (IR) multiphoton dissociation as an alternative to collision-induced dissociation (CID) for the differentiation of isomers. CID, including energy-resolved methods, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have also been utilized widely for structural characterization of numerous classes of flavonoids and development of structure/activity relationships.The gas-phase ion chemistry of flavonoids is an active area of research particularly when combined with accurate mass measurement for distinguishing between isobaric ions. Applications of a variety of ab initio and chemical computation methods to the study of flavonoids have been reported, and the results of computations of ion and molecular structures have been shown together with computations of atomic charges and ion fragmentation. Unambiguous ion structures are obtained rarely using MS alone. Thus, it is necessary to combine MS with spectroscopic techniques such as ultraviolet (UV) and NMR to achieve this objective. The application of NMR data to the mass spectrometric examination of flavonoids is discussed.},

abstract = {Glycosyltransferases catalyze glycosidic bond formation using sugar donors containing a nucleoside phosphate or a lipid phosphate leaving group. Only two structural folds, GT-A and GT-B, have been identified for the nucleotide sugar-dependent enzymes, but other folds are now appearing for the soluble domains of lipid phosphosugar-dependent glycosyl transferases. Structural and kinetic studies have provided new insights. Inverting glycosyltransferases utilize a direct displacement S(N)2-like mechanism involving an enzymatic base catalyst. Leaving group departure in GT-A fold enzymes is typically facilitated via a coordinated divalent cation, whereas GT-B fold enzymes instead use positively charged side chains and/or hydroxyls and helix dipoles. The mechanism of retaining glycosyltransferases is less clear. The expected two-step double-displacement mechanism is rendered less likely by the lack of conserved architecture in the region where a catalytic nucleophile would be expected. A mechanism involving a short-lived oxocarbenium ion intermediate now seems the most likely, with the leaving phosphate serving as the base.},

abstract = {General thermodynamic calculations using the semiempiric PM3 method have led to the conclusion that prenyldiphosphate converting enzymes require at least one divalent metal cation for the activation and cleavage of the diphosphate-prenyl ester bond, or they must provide structural elements for the efficient stabilization of the intermediate prenyl cation. The most important common structural features, which guide the product specificity in both terpene synthases and aromatic prenyl transferases are aromatic amino acid side chains, which stabilize prenyl cations by cation-pi: interactions. In the case of aromatic prenyl transferases, a proton abstraction from the phenolic hydroxyl group of the second substrate will enhance the electron density in the phenolic ortho-position at which initial prenylation of the aromatic compound usually occurs. A model of the structure of the integral transmembrane-bound aromatic prenyl transferase UbiA was developed, which currently represents the first structural insight into this group of prenylating enzymes with a fold different from most other aromatic prenyl transferases. Based on this model, the structure-activity relationships and mechanistic aspects of related proteins, for example those of Lithospermum erythrorhizon or the enzyme AuaA from Stigmatella aurantiaca involved in the aurachin biosynthesis, were elucidated. The high similarity of this group of aromatic prenyltransferases to 5-epi-aristolochene synthase is an indication of an evolutionary relationship with terpene synthases (cyclases). This is further supported by the conserved DxxxD motif found in both protein families. In contrast, there is no such relationship to the aromatic prenyl transferases with an ABBA-fold, such as NphB, or to any other known family of prenyl converting enzymes. Therefore, it is possible that these two groups might have different evolutionary ancestors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Adenosine is undoubtedly an ancient biological molecule that is a component of many enzyme cofactors: ATP, FADH, NAD(P)H, and coenzyme A, to name but a few, and, of course, of RNA. Here we present an overview of the role of adenosine in its most reactive form: as an organic radical formed either by homolytic cleavage of adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B(12), AdoCbl) or by single-electron reduction of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) complexed to an iron-sulfur cluster. Although many of the enzymes we discuss are newly discovered, adenosine's role as a radical cofactor most likely arose very early in evolution, before the advent of photosynthesis and the production of molecular oxygen, which rapidly inactivates many radical enzymes. AdoCbl-dependent enzymes appear to be confined to a rather narrow repertoire of rearrangement reactions involving 1,2-hydrogen atom migrations; nevertheless, mechanistic insights gained from studying these enzymes have proved extremely valuable in understanding how enzymes generate and control highly reactive free radical intermediates. In contrast, there has been a recent explosion in the number of radical-AdoMet enzymes discovered that catalyze a remarkably wide range of chemically challenging reactions; here there is much still to learn about their mechanisms. Although all the radical-AdoMet enzymes so far characterized come from anaerobically growing microbes and are very oxygen sensitive, there is tantalizing evidence that some of these enzymes might be active in aerobic organisms including humans.},

abstract = {(L)-Arginine hydrochloride (Arg HCl) has been used for protein refolding as a universal aggregation suppressor for monomeric proteins. This paper presents an investigation of the refolding of tetrameric beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) using Arg HCl and other salts. In a binary system using only Arg HCl, the refolding yield of beta-gal increased with increasing concentration up to 0.2 M. However, the refolding yield sharply decreased above this concentration, reaching the level below the control yield of 5\% at 0.5 M and near zero above 0.75 M, an observation unexpected from monomeric proteins. In a ternary system using both 0.2 M Arg HCl and another salt, the refolding yield increased up to 1.5-fold higher than that in the binary system. These data indicate that aggregation suppressive effects of protein increase with Arg HCl concentration, but also are deleterious to self-association of the protein. This dual nature of Arg HCl effects may have to be taken into account in its application for refolding of oligomeric proteins.},

abstract = {A search of the Streptomyces avermitilis genome reveals that its closest homologs are several O-methyltransferases. Among them, one gene (viz., saomt5) was cloned into the pET-15b expression vector by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers. Biochemical characterization with the recombinant protein showed that SaOMT5 was S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent Omethyltransferase. Several compounds were tested as substrates of SaOMT5. As a result, SaOMT5 catalyzed Omethylation of flavonoids such as 6,7-dihydroxyflavone, 2',3'-dihydroxyflavone, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone, quercetin, and 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, and phenolic compounds such as caffeic acid and caffeoyl Co-A. These reaction products were analyzed by TLC, HPLC, LC/MS, and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, SaOMT5 could convert phenolic compounds containing ortho-dihydroxy groups into Omethylated compounds, and 6,7-dihydroxyflavone was known to be the best substrate. SaOMT5 converted 6,7- dihydroxyflavone into 6-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone and 7-hydroxy-6-methoxyflavone, and caffeic acid into ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, respectively. Moreover, SaOMT5 turned out to be a Mg2+-dependent OMT, and the effect of Mg2+ ion on its activity was five times greater than those of Ca2+, Fe2+, and Cu2+ ions, EDTA, and metal-free medium.},

abstract = {An experimental design was employed to optimize the refolding conditions of a recombinant lipase from Pseudomonas sp. which expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The effects of several variables on the refolding and activation of the enzyme has been studied. Because of the complexity of the reaction with respect to the number of parameters that can affect the refolding efficiency, 26-1 half-fractional factorial design (H-FFD) was employed for initial screening of the factors, potentially influencing the response. Experiments were performed in triplicate at two levels. Subsequently, the selected factors were subjected to response surface methodology (RSM) with a four factor-five coded level central composite design (CCD), using Quadratic model for obtaining the optimum values for the factors. The adequacy of the calculated model was confirmed by the coefficient of determination (R2) and F value of 0.89 and 9.12, respectively. The optimized condition for the refolding was obtained in the refolding buffer containing unfolded lipase (10 ??g/ml) and foldase (3 ??g/ml) in combination with glycerol (10\%), NaCl (1 M) and sucrose (0.5 M). Using chemicals in combination with foldase under the optimal condition exhibited a 50\% increase in refolding yield over the conventional method. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methylation of adenine 58 in the T-loop of tRNAs is essential for cell growth in yeast or for adaptation to high temperatures in thermophilic organisms. In contrast to bacterial and eukaryotic tRNA m(1)A58 methyltransferases that are site-specific, the homologous archaeal enzyme from Pyrococcus abyssi catalyzes the formation of m(1)A also at the adjacent position 57, m(1)A57 being a precursor of 1-methylinosine. We report here the crystal structure of P. abyssi tRNA m(1)A57/58 methyltransferase ((Pab)TrmI), in complex with S-adenosyl-L-methionine or S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine in three different space groups. The fold of the monomer and the tetrameric architecture are similar to those of the bacterial enzymes. However, the inter-monomer contacts exhibit unique features. In particular, four disulfide bonds contribute to the hyperthermostability of the archaeal enzyme since their mutation lowers the melting temperature by 16.5°C. His78 in conserved motif X, which is present only in TrmIs from the Thermococcocales order, lies near the active site and displays two alternative conformations. Mutagenesis indicates His78 is important for catalytic efficiency of (Pab)TrmI. When A59 is absent in tRNA(Asp), only A57 is modified. Identification of the methylated positions in tRNAAsp by mass spectrometry confirms that (Pab)TrmI methylates the first adenine of an AA sequence.},

abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

Despite the progress in genomics, structural proteomics, and computational biology, functional annotation of methyltransferases remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis and activity of a new AdoMet analogue functionalized with a ketone group. Using catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT, EC 2.1.1.6) and thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT, EC 2.1.1.67) as model enzymes, this robust and readily accessible analogue displays kinetic parameters that are comparable to AdoMet and exhibits multiple turnovers with enzyme. More importantly, this AdoMet surrogate displays the same substrate specificity as the natural methyl donor. Incorporation of the ketone group allows for subsequent modification via bio-orthogonal labeling strategies and sensitive detection of the tagged ketone products. Hence, this AdoMet analogue expands the toolbox available to interrogate the biochemical functions of methyltransferases.},

abstract = {4-Coumaric acid:CoA ligase (4CL) is the central enzyme of the plant-specific phenylpropanoid pathway. It catalyzes the synthesis of hydroxycinnamate-CoA thioesters, the precursors of lignin and other important phenylpropanoids, in two-step reactions involving the formation of hydroxycinnamate-AMP anhydride and then the nucleophilic substitution of AMP by CoA. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of Populus tomentosa 4CL1 in the unmodified (apo) form and in forms complexed with AMP and adenosine 5'-(3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl)phosphate (APP), an intermediate analog, at 2.4, 2.5, and 1.9 \AA resolution, respectively. 4CL1 consists of two globular domains connected by a flexible linker region. The larger N-domain contains a substrate binding pocket, while the C-domain contains catalytic residues. Upon binding of APP, the C-domain rotates 81° relative to the N-domain. The crystal structure of 4CL1-APP reveals its substrate binding pocket. We identified residues essential for catalytic activities (Lys-438, Gln-443, and Lys-523) and substrate binding (Tyr-236, Gly-306, Gly-331, Pro-337, and Val-338) based on their crystal structures and by means of mutagenesis and enzymatic activity studies. We also demonstrated that the size of the binding pocket is the most important factor in determining the substrate specificities of 4CL1. These findings shed light on the enzymatic mechanisms of 4CLs and provide a solid foundation for the bioengineering of these enzymes.},

abstract = {Refolding of proteins from solubilized inclusion bodies still represents a major challenge for many recombinantly expressed proteins and often constitutes a major bottleneck. As in vitro refolding is a complex reaction with a variety of critical parameters, suitable refolding conditions are typically derived empirically in extensive screening experiments. Here, we introduce a new strategy that combines screening and optimization of refolding yields with a genetic algorithm (GA). The experimental setup was designed to achieve a robust and universal method that should allow optimizing the folding of a variety of proteins with the same routine procedure guided by the GA. In the screen, we incorporated a large number of common refolding additives and conditions. Using this design, the refolding of four structurally and functionally different model proteins was optimized experimentally, achieving 74-100\% refolding yield for all of them. Interestingly, our results show that this new strategy provides optimum conditions not only for refolding but also for the activity of the native enzyme. It is designed to be generally applicable and seems to be eligible for all enzymes.},

As deduced from their structures, an N-methylation on the amide bond is required among the various modifications. The protein encoded by asm10 belongs to the SAM-dependent methyltransferase family. Through gene inactivation and complementation, asm10 was proved to be responsible for the N-methylation of ansamitocins. Asm10 is a 33.0 kDa monomer, as determined by gel filtration. By using N-desmethyl-ansamitocin P-3 as substrate, the optimal temperature and pH for Asm10 catalysis were determined to be 32 °C and 10.0, respectively. Asm10 also showed broad substrate flexibility toward other N-desmethyl-ansamycins and synthetic indolin-2-ones. Through site-directed mutagenesis, Asp154 and Leu155 of Asm10 were confirmed to be essential for its catalysis, possibly through the binding of SAM. The characterization of this unique N-methyltransferase has enriched the toolbox for engineering N-methylated derivatives from both natural and synthetic compounds; this will allow known potential drugs to be modified.},

Here we reported the development of a clickable SAM analogue cofactor, 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl SAM, and its implementation to label substrates of human protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). In the system, the SAM analogue cofactor, coupled with matched PRMT1 mutants rather than native PRMT1, was shown to label PRMT1 substrates. The transferable 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl moiety of the SAM analogue further allowed corresponding modified substrates to be characterized through a subsequent click chemical ligation with an azido-based probe. The SAM analogue, in combination with a rational protein-engineering approach, thus shows potential to label and identify PMT targets in the context of a complex cellular mixture.},

These inclusion bodies, which contain the recombinant protein in an highly enriched form, can be isolated by solid/liquid separation. After solubilization, native proteins can be generated from the inactive material by using in vitro folding techniques. New folding procedures have been developed for efficient in vitro reconstitution of complex hydrophobic, multidomain, oligomeric, or highly disulfide-bonded proteins. These protocols take into account process parameters such as protein concentration, catalysis of disulfide bond formation, temperature, pH, and ionic strength, as well as specific solvent ingredients that reduce unproductive side reactions. Modification of the protein sequence has been exploited to improve in vitro folding.},

abstract = {Methylation is one of the most common chemical modifications of biologically active molecules and it occurs in all life forms. Its functional role is very diverse and involves many essential cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcriptional control, biosynthesis, and metabolism. Here, we provide further insight into the enzymatic methylation in S. cerevisiae by conducting a comprehensive structural and functional survey of all the methyltransferases encoded in its genome. Using distant homology detection and fold recognition, we found that the S. cerevisiae methyltransferome comprises 86 MTases (53 well-known and 33 putative with unknown substrate specificity). Structural classification of their catalytic domains shows that these enzymes may adopt nine different folds, the most common being the Rossmann-like. We also analyzed the domain architecture of these proteins and identified several new domain contexts. Interestingly, we found that the majority of MTase genes are periodically expressed during yeast metabolic cycle. This finding, together with calculated isoelectric point, fold assignment and cellular localization, was used to develop a novel approach for predicting substrate specificity. Using this approach, we predicted the general substrates for 24 of 33 putative MTases and confirmed these predictions experimentally in both cases tested. Finally, we show that, in S. cerevisiae, methylation is carried out by 34 RNA MTases, 32 protein MTases, eight small molecule MTases, three lipid MTases, and nine MTases with still unknown substrate specificity.},

Methyl transfer to the substrate requires reductive cleavage of a second equivalent of SAM. Crystal structures of RlmN and RlmN with SAM show that a single molecule of SAM coordinates the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Residue Cys(355) is S-methylated and located proximal to the SAM methyl group, suggesting the SAM that is involved in the initial methyl transfer binds at the same site. Thus, RlmN accomplishes its complex reaction with structural economy, harnessing the two most important reactivities of SAM within a single site.},

The tRNA:methyltransferase Trm1 transferred the extended alkynyl moiety to its natural target, the N2 of guanosine 26 in tRNA(Phe). LC/MS and LC/MS/MS techniques were used to detect and characterize the modified nucleoside as well as its cycloaddition product with a fluorescent azide.

abstract = {Protein methyltransferases (PMTs) catalyze arginine and lysine methylation of diverse histone and nonhistone targets. These posttranslational modifications play essential roles in regulating multiple cellular events in an epigenetic manner. In the recent process of defining PMT targets, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analogues have emerged as powerful small molecule probes to label and profile PMT targets. To examine efficiently the reactivity of PMTs and their variants on SAM analogues, we transformed a fluorogenic PMT assay into a ready high throughput screening (HTS) format. The reformulated fluorogenic assay is featured by its uncoupled but more robust character with the first step of accumulation of the commonly-shared reaction byproduct S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), followed by SAH-hydrolase-mediated fluorogenic quantification. The HTS readiness and robustness of the assay were demonstrated by its excellent Z' values of 0.83-0.95 for the so-far-examined 8 human PMTs with SAM as a cofactor (PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1, SUV39H2, SET7/9, SET8, G9a and GLP1). The fluorogenic assay was further implemented to screen the PMTs against five SAM analogues (allyl-SAM, propargyl-SAM, (E)-pent-2-en-4-ynyl-SAM (EnYn-SAM), (E)-hex-2-en-5-ynyl-SAM (Hey-SAM) and 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl-SAM (Pob-SAM)). Among the examined 8 × 5 pairs of PMTs and SAM analogues, native SUV39H2, G9a and GLP1 showed promiscuous activity on allyl-SAM. In contrast, the bulky SAM analogues, such as EnYn-SAM, Hey-SAM and Pob-SAM, are inert toward the panel of human PMTs. These findings therefore provide the useful structure-activity guidance to further evolve PMTs and SAM analogues for substrate labeling. The current assay format is ready to screen methyltransferase variants on structurally-diverse SAM analogues.},

PKMTs are likely to have many additional substrates in addition to histones, but relatively few nonhistone substrates have been characterized, and the substrate specificity for many PKMTs has yet to be defined. Thus, new unbiased methods are needed to find PKMT substrates. Here, we describe a chemical biology approach for unbiased, proteome-wide identification of novel PKMT substrates. Our strategy makes use of an alkyne-bearing S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analogue, which is accepted by the PKMT, SETDB1, as a cofactor, resulting in the enzymatic attachment of a terminal alkyne to its substrate. Such labeled proteins can then be treated with azide-functionalized probes to ligate affinity handles or fluorophores to the PKMT substrates. As a proof-of-concept, we have used SETDB1 to transfer the alkyne moiety from the SAM analogue onto a recombinant histone H3 substrate. We anticipate that this chemical method will find broad use in epigenetics to enable unbiased searches for new PKMT substrates by using recombinant enzymes and unnatural SAM cofactors to label and purify many substrates simultaneously from complex organelle or cell extracts.},

Here we report the genetic confirmation and biochemical characterization of TiaS5 as a sugar-O-methyltransferase, requisite for tiacumicin B biosynthesis. The tiaS5-inactivation mutant is capable of producing 14 tiacumicin analogues (11 of which are new), all lacking the 2'-O-methyl group on the internal rhamnose moiety. Notably, two tiacumicin analogues exhibit improved antibacterial properties. We have also biochemically verified TiaS5 as an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase, requiring divalent metal ions for activity. Substrate probing revealed TiaS5 to be a promiscuous enzyme, recognizing 12 tiacumicin analogues. These findings unequivocally establish that TiaS5 functions as a 2'-O-methyltransferase and provide direct biochemical evidence that TiaS5-catalyzed methylation is a tailoring step after glycosyl coupling in tiacumicin B biosynthesis.},

The kinetics of several methyltransferases has been well characterized; however, the details regarding their structural mechanisms have remained unclear to date. Using catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) as a model, we perform discrete molecular dynamics and computational docking simulations to elucidate the initial stages of cofactor binding. We find that COMT binds SAM via an induced-fit mechanism, where SAM adopts a different docking pose in the absence of metal and substrate in comparison to the holoenzyme. Flexible modeling of the active site side-chains is essential for observing the lowest energy state in the apoenzyme; rigid docking tools are unable to recapitulate the pose unless the appropriate side-chain conformations are given a priori. From our docking results, we hypothesize that the metal reorients SAM in a conformation suitable for donating its methyl substituent to the recipient ligand. The proposed mechanism enables a general understanding of how divalent metal cations contribute to methyltransferase function.},

As such, there is a growing need to develop chemical reporters to examine the physiological and pathological roles of protein methyltransferases. Several sterically bulky SAM analogues have previously been used to label substrates of specific protein methyltransferases. However, broad application of these compounds has been limited by their general incompatibility with native enzymes. Here we report a SAM surrogate, ProSeAM (propargylic Se-adenosyl-l-selenomethionine), as a reporter of methyltransferases. ProSeAM can be processed by multiple protein methyltransferases for substrate labeling. In contrast, sulfur-based propargylic SAM undergoes rapid decomposition at physiological pH, likely via an allene intermediate. In conjunction with fluorescent/affinity-based azide probes, copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry, in-gel fluorescence visualization and proteomic analysis, we further demonstrated ProSeAM's utility to profile substrates of endogenous methyltransferases in diverse cellular contexts. These results thus feature ProSeAM as a convenient probe to study the activities of endogenous protein methyltransferases.},

Together with other ”omics“ data, the investigation of the metabolome is an essential part of systems biology.

For example, the analysis of metabolic processes during growth or virulence factor expression is crucially important to understand pathogenesis of bacteria. Common bioanalytical techniques for metabolome analysis include liquid and gas chromatographic methods coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS and GC-MS) and spectroscopic approaches such as NMR. In order to achieve metabolome data representing the physiological status of a microorganism, well-verified protocols for sampling and analysis are necessary. This chapter presents a detailed protocol for metabolome analysis of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. A detailed manual for cell sampling and metabolite extraction is given, followed by the description of the analytical procedures GC-MS and LC-MS. The advantages and limitations of each experimental setup are discussed. Here, a guideline specified for S. aureus metabolomics and information for important protocol steps are presented, to avoid common pitfalls in microbial metabolome analysis.},

abstract = {The addition of a methyl moiety to a small chemical is a common transformation in the biosynthesis of natural products across all three domains of life. These methylation reactions are most often catalysed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTs). MTs are categorized based on the electron-rich, methyl accepting atom, usually O, N, C, or S. SAM-dependent natural product MTs (NPMTs) are responsible for the modification of a wide array of structurally distinct substrates, including signalling and host defense compounds, pigments, prosthetic groups, cofactors, cell membrane and cell wall components, and xenobiotics. Most notably, methylation modulates the bioavailability, bioactivity, and reactivity of acceptor molecules, and thus exerts a central role on the functional output of many metabolic pathways. Our current understanding of the structural enzymology of NPMTs groups these phylogenetically diverse enzymes into two MT-superfamily fold classes (class I and class III). Structural biology has also shed light on the catalytic mechanisms and molecular bases for substrate specificity for over fifty NPMTs. These biophysical-based approaches have contributed to our understanding of NPMT evolution, demonstrating how a widespread protein fold evolved to accommodate chemically diverse methyl acceptors and to catalyse disparate mechanisms suited to the physiochemical properties of the target substrates. This evolutionary diversity suggests that NPMTs may serve as starting points for generating new biocatalysts.},

abstract = {Polymethoxylated flavonoids occur in a number of plant families, including the Lamiaceae. To date, the metabolic pathways giving rise to the diversity of these compounds have not been studied. Analysis of our expressed sequence tag database for four sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) lines afforded identification of candidate flavonoid O-methyltransferase genes. Recombinant proteins displayed distinct substrate preferences and product specificities that can account for all detected 7-/6-/4'-methylated, 8-unsubstituted flavones. Their biochemical specialization revealed only certain metabolic routes to be highly favorable and therefore likely in vivo. Flavonoid O-methyltransferases catalyzing 4'- and 6-O-methylations shared high identity (approximately 90\%), indicating that subtle sequence changes led to functional differentiation. Structure homology modeling suggested the involvement of several amino acid residues in defining the proteins' stringent regioselectivities. The roles of these individual residues were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, revealing two discrete mechanisms as a basis for the switch between 6- and 4'-O-methylation of two different substrates. These findings delineate major pathways in a large segment of the flavone metabolic network and provide a foundation for its further elucidation.},

abstract = {Stress-responsive dihydroxy B-ring-substituted flavonoids have great potential to inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce the levels of ROS once they are formed, i.e., to perform antioxidant functions. These flavonoids are located within or in the proximity of centers of ROS generation in severely stressed plants. Efficient mechanisms have been recently identified for the transport of flavonoids from the endoplasmic reticulum, the site of their biosynthesis, to different cellular compartments. The mechanism underlying flavonoid-mediated ROS reduction in plants is still unclear. 'Antioxidant' flavonoids are found in the chloroplast, which suggests a role as scavengers of singlet oxygen and stabilizers of the chloroplast outer envelope membrane. Dihydroxy B-ring substituted flavonoids are present in the nucleus of mesophyll cells and may inhibit ROS-generation making complexes with Fe and Cu ions. The genes that govern the biosynthesis of antioxidant flavonoids are present in liverworts and mosses and are mostly up-regulated as a consequence of severe stress. This suggests that the antioxidant flavonoid metabolism is a robust trait of terrestrial plants. Vacuolar dihydroxy B-ring flavonoids have been reported to serve as co-substrates for vacuolar peroxidases to reduce H(2)O(2) escape from the chloroplast, following the depletion of ascorbate peroxidase activity. Antioxidant flavonoids may effectively control key steps of cell growth and differentiation, thus acting regulating the development of the whole plant and individual organs.},

There is wide interest in a range of medical and dietary applications, and having a rapid, reliable method for structural elucidation is essential. In this study a range of flavonoid standards are investigated by chip-based negative ion nanospray mass spectrometry. It was found that the different classes of flavonoid studied have a combination of distinct neutral losses from the precursor ion [M-H](-) along with characteristic low-mass ions. By looking only for this distinct pattern of product ions, it is possible to determine the class of flavonoid directly. This methodology is tested here by the analysis of a green tea extract, where the expected flavonoids were readily identified, along with quercetin, which is shown to be present at only about 2\% of the most intense ion in the spectrum.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flavonoids comprise a large family of secondary plant metabolic intermediates that exhibit a wide variety of antioxidant and human health-related properties. Plant production of flavonoids is limited by the low productivity and the complexity of the recovered flavonoids. Thus to overcome these limitations, metabolic engineering of specific pathway in microbial systems have been envisaged to produce high quantity of a single molecules.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce the key intermediate flavonoid, naringenin, solely from glucose. For this, specific naringenin biosynthesis genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were selected by comparative expression profiling and introduced in S. cerevisiae. The sole expression of these A. thaliana genes yielded low extracellular naringenin concentrations (<5.5 $\mu$M). To optimize naringenin titers, a yeast chassis strain was developed. Synthesis of aromatic amino acids was deregulated by alleviating feedback inhibition of 3-deoxy-d-arabinose-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (Aro3, Aro4) and byproduct formation was reduced by eliminating phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Aro10, Pdc5, Pdc6). Together with an increased copy number of the chalcone synthase gene and expression of a heterologous tyrosine ammonia lyase, these modifications resulted in a 40-fold increase of extracellular naringenin titers (to approximately 200 $\mu$M) in glucose-grown shake-flask cultures. In aerated, pH controlled batch reactors, extracellular naringenin concentrations of over 400 $\mu$M were reached.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results reported in this study demonstrate that S. cerevisiae is capable of de novo production of naringenin by coexpressing the naringenin production genes from A. thaliana and optimization of the flux towards the naringenin pathway. The engineered yeast naringenin production host provides a metabolic chassis for production of a wide range of flavonoids and exploration of their biological functions.},

abstract = {S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is a universal biological cofactor that is found in all branches of life where it plays a critical role in the transfer of methyl groups to various biomolecules, including DNA, proteins and small-molecule secondary metabolites. The methylation process thus has important implications in various disease processes and applications in industrial chemical processing. This methyl transfer is catalysed by SAM-dependent methyltransferases (MTases), which are by far the largest groups of SAM-dependent enzymes. A significant amount is now known regarding the structural biology and enzymology of these enzymes, and, consequently, there is now significant scope for the development of new MTases and SAM analogues for applications from biomolecular imaging to biocatalytic industrial processes. This review will focus on current efforts in the manipulation of class I and V SAM-dependent MTases and the use of synthetic SAM analogues, which together offer the best prospects for rational redesign towards biotechnological applications. Firstly, metabolic engineering of organisms incorporating small-molecule MTases is discussed; this can be applied in a variety of areas from the industrial bioprocessing of flavourants and antibiotics to frontier research in biofuel production and bioremediation. Secondly, the application of MTases in combination with SAM analogues is reviewed; this allows the tagging of proteins and oligonucleotides with moieties other than the methyl group. Such tagging allows the isolation of the tagged biomolecule and aids its visualisation by a range of analytical methods. The review then summarises the potential advantages of MTase-mediated chemistry and offers some future perspectives on downstream applications.},

abstract = {Circular dichroism (CD) is a spectroscopic technique commonly used to investigate the structure of proteins. Major secondary structure types, alpha-helices and beta-strands, produce distinctive CD spectra. Thus, by comparing the CD spectrum of a protein of interest to a reference set consisting of CD spectra of proteins of known structure, predictive methods can estimate the secondary structure of the protein. Currently available methods, including K2D2, use such experimental CD reference sets, which are very small in size when compared to the number of tertiary structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Conversely, given a PDB structure, it is possible to predict a theoretical CD spectrum from it. The methodological framework for this calculation was established long ago but only recently a convenient implementation called DichroCalc has been developed. In this study, we set to determine whether theoretically derived spectra could be used as reference set for accurate CD based predictions of secondary structure. We used DichroCalc to calculate the theoretical CD spectra of a nonredundant set of structures representing most proteins in the PDB, and applied a straightforward approach for predicting protein secondary structure content using these theoretical CD spectra as reference set. We show that this method improves the predictions, particularly for the wavelength interval between 200 and 240 nm and for beta-strand content. We have implemented this method, called K2D3, in a publicly accessible web server at http://www. ogic.ca/projects/k2d3. Proteins 2011. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids in a medicinal Chinese herb Taraxacum formosanum Kitam. Initially, both phenolic acids and flavonoids were extracted with 50\% ethanol in a water-bath at 60 °C for 3 h and eventually separated into acidic fraction and neutral fraction by using a C(18) cartridge. A total of 29 compounds were separated within 68 min by employing a Gemini C(18) column and a gradient solvent system of 0.1\% formic acid and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Based on the retention behavior as well as absorption and mass spectra, 19 phenolic acids and 10 flavonoids were identified and quantified in T. formosanum, with the former ranging from 14.1 $\mu$g/g to 10,870.4 $\mu$g/g, and the latter from 9.9 $\mu$g/g to 325.8 $\mu$g/g. For further identification of flavonoids, a post-column derivatization method involving shift reagents such as sodium acetate or aluminum chloride was used and the absorption spectral characteristics without or with shift reagents were compared. An internal standard syringic acid was used for quantitation of phenolic acids, whereas (±) naringenin was found suitable for quantitation of flavonoids. The developed LC-MS/MS method showed high reproducibility, as evident from the relative standard deviation (RSD) values for intra-day and inter-day variability being 1.0-6.8\% and 2.0-7.7\% for phenolic acids and 3.7-7.4\% and 1.5-8.1\% for flavonoids, respectively, and thus may be applied for simultaneous determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids in Chinese herb and nutraceuticals.},

In vitro investigations using the highly-reducing fungal polyketide synthase CazF revealed that its methyltransferase domain accepts the nonnatural cofactor propargylic Se-adenosyl-l-methionine and can transfer the propargyl moiety onto its growing polyketide chain. This propargylated polyketide product can then be further chain-extended and cyclized to form propargyl-$\alpha$ pyrone or be processed fully into the alkyne-containing 4'-propargyl-chaetoviridin A.},

We had previously described synthesis and application of AdoMet analogues carrying sulfonium-bound 4-substituted but-2-ynyl side chains for transfer by methyltransferases. Although useful in certain applications, these cofactor analogues exhibited short lifetimes in physiological buffers. Examination of the reaction kinetics and products showed that their fast inactivation followed a different pathway than observed for AdoMet and rather involved a pH-dependent addition of a water molecule to the side chain. This side reaction was eradicated by synthesis of a series of cofactor analogues in which the separation between an electronegative group and the triple bond was increased from one to three carbon units. The designed hex-2-ynyl moiety-based cofactor analogues with terminal amino, azide, or alkyne groups showed a markedly improved enzymatic transalkylation activity and proved well suitable for methyltransferase-directed sequence-specific labeling of DNA in vitro and in bacterial cell lysates.},

abstract = {S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-based methylation is integral to metabolism and signaling. AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases belong to multiple distinct classes and share a catalytic mechanism that arose through convergent evolution; however, fundamental determinants underlying this shared methyl transfer mechanism remain undefined. A survey of high-resolution crystal structures reveals that unconventional carbon-oxygen (CH···O) hydrogen bonds coordinate the AdoMet methyl group in different methyltransferases irrespective of their class, active site structure, or cofactor binding conformation. Corroborating these observations, quantum chemistry calculations demonstrate that these charged interactions formed by the AdoMet sulfonium cation are stronger than typical CH···O hydrogen bonds. Biochemical and structural studies using a model lysine methyltransferase and an active site mutant that abolishes CH···O hydrogen bonding to AdoMet illustrate that these interactions are important for high-affinity AdoMet binding and transition-state stabilization. Further, crystallographic and NMR dynamics experiments of the wild-type enzyme demonstrate that the CH···O hydrogen bonds constrain the motion of the AdoMet methyl group, potentially facilitating its alignment during catalysis. Collectively, the experimental findings with the model methyltransferase and structural survey imply that methyl CH···O hydrogen bonding represents a convergent evolutionary feature of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, mediating a universal mechanism for methyl transfer.},

Second, several genes for the biosynthesis of ponciretin and sakuranetin such as tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and O-methyltransferase (OMT) were overexpressed. In order to increase the supply the Coenzyme A (CoA), one gene (icdA, isocitrate dehydrogenase) was deleted.

Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents, thus, have been paid great attention to replace current harsh organic solvents and have been applied to many chemical processing such as extraction and synthesis. However, current ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents have still limitations to be applied to a real chemical industry due to toxicity against human and environment and high cost of ILs and solid state of most deep eutectic solvents at room temperature. Recently we discovered that many plant abundant primary metabolites changed their state from solid to liquid when they were mixed in proper ratio. This finding made us hypothesize that natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) play a role as alternative media to water in living organisms and tested a wide range of natural products, which resulted in discovery of over 100 NADES from nature. In order to prove deep eutectic feature the interaction between the molecules was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All the tested NADES show clear hydrogen bonding between components. As next step physical properties of NADES such as water activity, density, viscosity, polarity and thermal properties were measured as well as the effect of water on the physical properties. In the last stage the novel NADES were applied to the solubilization of wide range of biomolecules such as non-water soluble bioactive natural products, gluten, starch, and DNA. In most cases the solubility of the biomolecules evaluated in this study was greatly higher than water. Based on the results the novel NADES may be expected as potential green solvents at room temperature in diverse fields of chemistry. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The number of newly discovered reactions within cofactor-dependent enzyme families increases continuously. A knowledge based categorization of cofactors with respect to their chemical properties shows that within enzymes they are not used for the catalysis of singular types of reactions and functionalities. Therefore, in many cases an unambiguous and narrow classification does not seem sufficient. Rather, the functional diversity of cofactors found in enzymes represents variations around specific themes with regard to a catalysed reaction and the cofactor chemistry. Furthermore, organic cofactor molecules are also used for non-enzymatic functions. Two representative cofactors are exemplarily discussed in detail, thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) as a self-sufficient cofactor and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), as both a catalytic and building-block-delivering cofactor. A further synopsis on selected examples of organic cofactors emphasizes the discovery and application of new enzymatic activities based on the cofactor-dependent chemistry and shows how bioinspired synthesis approaches expand catalytic and non-catalytic synthesis applications beyond natural solutions.},

abstract = {Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil (Narcissus spp.), snowdrop (Galanthus spp.), and summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum). Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor in the development of synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant O-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 4'-O-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 4'-O-methyltransferase (NpN4OMT) of the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway.},

abstract = {Covering: 2013The ability to transfer molecular species to the gas phase and ionize them is central to the study of natural products and other molecular species by mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based strategies in natural products have focused on a few established ion sources, such as electron impact and electrospray ionization. However, a variety of other ion sources are either currently in use to evaluate natural products or show significant future promise. This review discusses these various ion sources in the context of other articles in this special issue, but is also applicable to other fields of analysis, including materials science. Ion sources are grouped based on the current understanding of their predominant ion formation mechanisms. This broad overview groups ion sources into the following categories: electron ionization and single photon ionization; chemical ionization-like and plasma-based; electrospray ionization; and, laser desorption-based. Laser desorption-based methods are emphasized with specific examples given for laser desorption postionization sources and their use in the analysis of intact microbial biofilms. Brief consideration is given to the choice of ion source for various sample types and analyses, including MS imaging.},

For humans, these bioactive natural products often possess promising pharmaceutical properties. In this review, we focus on the two most interesting and well characterized secondary metabolite classes found in Medicago species, the triterpene saponins and the flavonoids, with a detailed overview of their biosynthesis, regulation, and profiling methods. Furthermore, their biological role within the plant as well as their potential utility for human health or other applications is discussed. Finally, we give an overview of the advances made in metabolic engineering in Medicago species and how the development of novel molecular and omics toolkits can influence a better understanding of this genus in terms of specialized metabolism and chemistry. Throughout, we critically analyze the current bottlenecks and speculate on future directions and opportunities for research and exploitation of Medicago metabolism.},

abstract = {A simple spectrophotometric microplate assay that allows quantification of the interaction between phospholipids and metal ions or other small cationic compounds has been developed. The assay is based on the competition of the phospholipids for the Fe3+ ion in the purple-colored Fe(III)-$\gamma$-resorcylate complex and for other cations. To compare the binding affinities of several cation-phospholipid interactions, K0.5 values were derived from binding curves constructed by determination of the absorbance of the Fe(III)-$\gamma$-resorcylate at 490 nm as a function of the cation concentration. The assay was used to analyze the binding of lanthanide ions, calcium ions, and amines (hydrochlorides of ethanolamine, spermidine, and hexyltrimethylammonium chloride) to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and mixed micelles containing anionic lipids such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl-p-nitrophenol. The method was evaluated by fluorescence measurements with Eu3+ ions as tracer. Lanthanide ions such as La3+ and Ce3+ ions showed K0.5 values smaller by one to two orders of magnitude compared with Ca2+ ions. In the presence of increasing amounts of detergents such as Triton X-100, the method also reflected transitions from SUVs to micelles. The binding capacity for metal ions was higher for phospholipid-containing micelles than for the corresponding SUVs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Human MAT II was among the most permissive of the MATs analyzed and enabled the chemoenzymatic synthesis of 29 non-native SAM analogues. As a proof of concept for the feasibility of natural product "alkylrandomization", a small set of differentially-alkylated indolocarbazole analogues was generated by using a coupled hMAT2-RebM system (RebM is the sugar C4'-O-methyltransferase that is involved in rebeccamycin biosynthesis).

@article{Zhu2014,
abstract = {The health benefits of flavonoids for humans are increasingly attracting attention. Because the extraction of high-purity flavonoids from plants presents a major obstacle, interest has emerged in biosynthesizing them using microbial hosts. Eriodictyol is a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Its efficient synthesis has been hampered by two factors: the poor expression of cytochrome P450 and the low intracellular malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) concentration in Escherichia coli. To address these issues, a truncated plant P450 flavonoid, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (tF3'H), was functionally expressed as a fusion protein with a truncated P450 reductase (tCPR) in E. coli. This allowed the engineered E. coli to produce eriodictyol from l-tyrosine by simultaneously coexpressing the fusion protein with tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI). In addition, metabolic engineering was employed to enhance the availability of malonyl-CoA so as to achieve a new metabolic balance and rebalance the relative expression of genes to enhance eriodictyol accumulation. This approach made the production of eriodictyol 203\% higher than that in the control strain. By using these strategies, the production of eriodictyol from l-tyrosine reached 107 mg/liter. The present work offers an approach to the efficient synthesis of other hydroxylated flavonoids from l-tyrosine or even glucose in E. coli.},

The regression PLS and PCR models built in this study were also used to predict the antimalarial activity of 30 new artemisinin compounds with unknown activity.

The significant molecular descriptors related to the compounds with antimalarial activity were the hydration energy (HE), the charge on the O11 oxygen atom (QO11), the torsion angle O1-O2-Fe-N2 (D2) and the maximum rate of R/Sanderson Electronegativity (RTe+).

Metabolomics-based approaches using modern mass spectrometry techniques can help to bridge the gap between genome-encoded potential for the production of secondary metabolites and the usually contradictory low numbers of compounds known from a specific producer. In this article recent studies are highlighted in which metabolomics-driven analysis played a crucial role for the discovery of novel secondary metabolites from microbial sources. We also exemplify how the implementation of metabolomics techniques facilitates the structural characterization of novel metabolites and contributes to the in-depth investigation of underlying biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, the constantly increasing role of secondary metabolomics for the identification of novel natural products in a drug discovery context is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methylated resveratrol analogs show similar biological activities that are comparable with those of the resveratrol. However, the methylated resveratrol analogs exhibit better bioavailability as they are more easily transported into the cell and more resistant to degradation. Although these compounds are widely used in human health care and in industrial materials, at present they are mainly obtained by extraction from raw plant sources. Accordingly their production can suffer from a variety of economic problems, including low levels of productivity and/or heterogeneous quality. On this backdrop, large-scale production of plant metabolites via microbial approaches is a promising alternative to chemical synthesis and extraction from plant sources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: An Escherichia coli system containing an artificial biosynthetic pathway that produces methylated resveratrol analogues, such as pinostilbene (3,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxystilbene), 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene, 3,4'-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene, and 3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene, from simple carbon sources is developed. These artificial biosynthetic pathways contain a series of codon-optimized O-methyltransferase genes from sorghum in addition to the resveratrol biosynthetic genes. The E. coli cells that harbor pET-opTLO1S or pET-opTLO3S produce the one-methyl resveratrol analogues of 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene and pinostilbene, respectively. Furthermore, the E. coli cells that harbor pET-opTLO13S produce 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene, bis-methyl resveratrol (3,4'-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene), and tri-methyl resveratrol (3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our strategy demonstrates the first harness microorganisms for de novo synthesis of methylated resveratrol analogs used a single vector system joined with resveratrol biosynthetic genes and sorghum two resveratrol O-methyltransferase genes.

Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. As inclusion bodies contain relatively pure and intact proteins, protein refolding is an important process to obtain active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, conventional refolding methods, such as dialysis and dilution, are time consuming and, often, recovered yields of active proteins are low, and a trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. Recently, several approaches have been reported to refold these aggregated proteins into an active form. The strategies largely aim at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure. This review focuses on protein refolding techniques using chemical additives and laminar flow in microfluidic chips for the efficient recovery of active proteins from inclusion bodies.},

Using this database, we demonstrated that secondary metabolite profile similarity is approximately, but not always, correlated with taxonomical similarity. We also validated the ability of this database to find species-specific metabolites, as well as to discover known bioactive compounds from previously unknown sources. An online interface to this database, as well as the accompanying software, is provided freely for the community to use.},

abstract = {Covering: up to 2013. Plant metabolomics is a relatively recent research field that has gained increasing interest in the past few years. Up to the present day numerous review articles and guide books on the subject have been published. This review article focuses on the current applications and limitations of the modern mass spectrometry techniques, especially in combination with electrospray ionisation (ESI), an ionisation method which is most commonly applied in metabolomics studies. As a possible alternative to ESI, perspectives on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) in metabolomics studies are introduced, a method which still is not widespread in the field. In metabolomics studies the results must always be interpreted in the context of the applied sampling procedures as well as data analysis. Different sampling strategies are introduced and the importance of data analysis is illustrated in the example of metabolic network modelling.},

abstract = {Methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) catalyze the formation of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) inside living cells. Recently, S-alkyl analogues of SAM have been documented as cofactor surrogates to label novel targets of methyltransferases. However, these chemically synthesized SAM analogues are not suitable for cell-based studies because of their poor membrane permeability. This issue was recently addressed under a cellular setting through a chemoenzymatic strategy to process membrane-permeable S-alkyl analogues of methionine (SAAMs) into the SAM analogues with engineered MATs. Here we describe a general sensitive activity assay for engineered MATs by converting the reaction products into S-alkylthioadenosines, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) quantification. With this assay, 40 human MAT mutants were evaluated against 7 SAAMs as potential substrates. The structure-activity relationship revealed that, besides better engaged SAAM binding by the MAT mutants (lower Km value in contrast to native MATs), the gained activity toward the bulky SAAMs stems from their ability to maintain the desired linear SN2 transition state (reflected by higher kcat value). Here the I117A mutant of human MATI was identified as the most active variant for biochemical production of SAM analogues from diverse SAAMs. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Walnuts (Juglans regia L.) have been described previously as a rich source of polyphenols with a broad array of different structures. However, an accurate screening of its complete phenolic profile is still lacking. In the present work, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization hybrid linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-LTQ-Orbitrap) was applied for a comprehensive identification of phenolic compounds in walnuts. A total of 120 compounds, including hydrolysable and condensed tannins, flavonoids and phenolic acids were identified or tentatively identified on the base of their retention times, accurate mass measurements and subsequent mass fragmentation data, or by comparing with reference substances and literature. The peak area of each signal in mass chromatograms was used to provide semiquantitative information for comparison purposes. The most abundant ions were observed for ellagitannins, ellagic acid and its derivatives. Furthermore, the high-resolution MS analysis revealed the presence of eight polyphenols that have never been reported in walnuts: stenophyllanin C, malabathrin A, eucalbanin A, cornusiin B, heterophylliin E, pterocarinin B, reginin A and alienanin B. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cofactor-dependent enzymes catalyze a broad range of synthetically useful transformations. However, the cofactor requirement also poses economic and practical challenges for the application of these biocatalysts. For three decades, considerable research effort has been devoted to the development of reliable in situ regeneration methods for the most commonly employed cofactors, particularly NADH and NADPH. Today, researchers can choose from a plethora of options, and oxidoreductases are routinely employed even on industrial scale. Nevertheless, more efficient cofactor regeneration methods are still being developed, with the aim of achieving better atom economy, simpler reaction setups, and higher productivities. Besides, cofactor dependence has been recognized as an opportunity to confer novel reactivity upon enzymes by engineering their cofactors, and to couple (redox) biotransformations in multi-enzyme cascade systems. These novel concepts will help to further establish cofactor-dependent biotransformations as an attractive option for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, chiral building blocks, and bio-based platform molecules.},

Manual interpretation of the resulting data is tedious and time-consuming, so methods for automated analysis are highly sought after. In this review, we focus on four recently developed methods for the detection and investigation of small molecules, namely MetFrag/MetFusion, ISIS, FingerID, and FT-BLAST. These methods have the potential to significantly advance the field of computational mass spectrometry for the research of natural products. For example, they may help with the dereplication of compounds at an early stage of the drug discovery process; that is, the detection of molecules that are identical or highly similar to known drugs or drug leads. Furthermore, when a potential drug lead has been determined, these tools may help to identify it and elucidate its structure.},

abstract = {Inorganic arsenic (As) is highly toxic and ubiquitous in the environment. Inorganic As can be transformed by microbial methylation, which constitutes an important part of the As biogeochemical cycle. In this study, we investigated As biotransformation by Pseudomonas alcaligenes NBRC14159. P. alcaligenes was able to methylate arsenite [As(III)] rapidly to dimethylarsenate and small amounts of trimethylarsenic oxide. An arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase, PaArsM, was identified and functionally characterized. PaArsM shares low similarities with other reported ArsM enzymes (less than 55\%). When P. alcaligenes arsM gene (PaarsM) was disrupted, the mutant lost As methylation ability and became more sensitive to As(III). PaarsM was expressed in the absence of As(III) and the expression was further enhanced by As(III) exposure. Heterologous expression of PaarsM in an As-hypersensitive strain of Escherichia coli conferred As(III) resistance. Purified PaArsM protein methylated As(III) to dimethylarsenate as the main product in the medium and also produced dimethylarsine and trimethylarsine gases. We propose that PaArsM plays a role in As methylation and detoxification of As(III) and could be exploited in bioremediation of As-contaminated environments.},

abstract = {Methylation of the toxic metalloid arsenic is widespread in nature. Members of every kingdom have arsenic(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransferase enzymes, which are termed ArsM in microbes and AS3MT in animals, including humans. Trivalent arsenic(III) is methylated up to three times to form methylarsenite [MAs(III)], dimethylarsenite [DMAs(III)] and the volatile trimethylarsine [TMAs(III)]. In microbes, arsenic methylation is a detoxification process. In humans, MAs(III) and DMAs(III) are more toxic and carcinogenic than either inorganic arsenate or arsenite. Here, new crystal structures are reported of ArsM from the thermophilic eukaryotic alga Cyanidioschyzon sp. 5508 (CmArsM) with the bound aromatic arsenicals phenylarsenite [PhAs(III)] at 1.80 A resolution and reduced roxarsone [Rox(III)] at 2.25 A resolution. These organoarsenicals are bound to two of four conserved cysteine residues: Cys174 and Cys224. The electron density extends the structure to include a newly identified conserved cysteine residue, Cys44, which is disulfide-bonded to the fourth conserved cysteine residue, Cys72. A second disulfide bond between Cys72 and Cys174 had been observed previously in a structure with bound SAM. The loop containing Cys44 and Cys72 shifts by nearly 6.5 A in the arsenic(III)-bound structures compared with the SAM-bound structure, which suggests that this movement leads to formation of the Cys72-Cys174 disulfide bond. A model is proposed for the catalytic mechanism of arsenic(III) SAM methyltransferases in which a disulfide-bond cascade maintains the products in the trivalent state.},

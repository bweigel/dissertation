abstract = {Macromolecular X-ray crystallography is routinely applied to understand biological processes at a molecular level. However, significant time and effort are still required to solve and complete many of these structures because of the need for manual interpretation of complex numerical data using many software packages and the repeated use of interactive three-dimensional graphics. PHENIX has been developed to provide a comprehensive system for macromolecular crystallographic structure solution with an emphasis on the automation of all procedures. This has relied on the development of algorithms that minimize or eliminate subjective input, the development of algorithms that automate procedures that are traditionally performed by hand and, finally, the development of a framework that allows a tight integration between the algorithms.},

abstract = {Stress-responsive dihydroxy B-ring-substituted flavonoids have great potential to inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduce the levels of ROS once they are formed, i.e., to perform antioxidant functions. These flavonoids are located within or in the proximity of centers of ROS generation in severely stressed plants. Efficient mechanisms have been recently identified for the transport of flavonoids from the endoplasmic reticulum, the site of their biosynthesis, to different cellular compartments. The mechanism underlying flavonoid-mediated ROS reduction in plants is still unclear. 'Antioxidant' flavonoids are found in the chloroplast, which suggests a role as scavengers of singlet oxygen and stabilizers of the chloroplast outer envelope membrane. Dihydroxy B-ring substituted flavonoids are present in the nucleus of mesophyll cells and may inhibit ROS-generation making complexes with Fe and Cu ions. The genes that govern the biosynthesis of antioxidant flavonoids are present in liverworts and mosses and are mostly up-regulated as a consequence of severe stress. This suggests that the antioxidant flavonoid metabolism is a robust trait of terrestrial plants. Vacuolar dihydroxy B-ring flavonoids have been reported to serve as co-substrates for vacuolar peroxidases to reduce H(2)O(2) escape from the chloroplast, following the depletion of ascorbate peroxidase activity. Antioxidant flavonoids may effectively control key steps of cell growth and differentiation, thus acting regulating the development of the whole plant and individual organs.},

abstract = {An experimental design was employed to optimize the refolding conditions of a recombinant lipase from Pseudomonas sp. which expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The effects of several variables on the refolding and activation of the enzyme has been studied. Because of the complexity of the reaction with respect to the number of parameters that can affect the refolding efficiency, 26-1 half-fractional factorial design (H-FFD) was employed for initial screening of the factors, potentially influencing the response. Experiments were performed in triplicate at two levels. Subsequently, the selected factors were subjected to response surface methodology (RSM) with a four factor-five coded level central composite design (CCD), using Quadratic model for obtaining the optimum values for the factors. The adequacy of the calculated model was confirmed by the coefficient of determination (R2) and F value of 0.89 and 9.12, respectively. The optimized condition for the refolding was obtained in the refolding buffer containing unfolded lipase (10 ??g/ml) and foldase (3 ??g/ml) in combination with glycerol (10{\%}), NaCl (1 M) and sucrose (0.5 M). Using chemicals in combination with foldase under the optimal condition exhibited a 50{\%} increase in refolding yield over the conventional method. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Refolding of proteins from solubilized inclusion bodies still represents a major challenge for many recombinantly expressed proteins and often constitutes a major bottleneck. As in vitro refolding is a complex reaction with a variety of critical parameters, suitable refolding conditions are typically derived empirically in extensive screening experiments. Here, we introduce a new strategy that combines screening and optimization of refolding yields with a genetic algorithm (GA). The experimental setup was designed to achieve a robust and universal method that should allow optimizing the folding of a variety of proteins with the same routine procedure guided by the GA. In the screen, we incorporated a large number of common refolding additives and conditions. Using this design, the refolding of four structurally and functionally different model proteins was optimized experimentally, achieving 74-100{\%} refolding yield for all of them. Interestingly, our results show that this new strategy provides optimum conditions not only for refolding but also for the activity of the native enzyme. It is designed to be generally applicable and seems to be eligible for all enzymes.},

Insufficient availability of cobalamin, or inhibition of methionine synthase by exposure to nitrous oxide, leads to diminished activity of this enzyme. In humans, severe inhibition of methionine synthase results in the development of megaloblastic anemia, and eventually in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. It also results in diminished intracellular folate levels and a redistribution of folate derivatives. In this review, we summarize recent progress in understanding the catalysis and regulation of this important enzyme from both bacterial and mammalian sources. Because inhibition of mammalian methionine synthase can restrict the incorporation of methyltetrahydrofolate from the blood into cellular folate pools that can be used for nucleotide biosynthesis, it is a potential chemotherapeutic target. The review emphasizes the mechanistic information that will be needed in order to design rational inhibitors of the enzyme.},

abstract = {Hydrolysis of plant biomass is achieved by the combined action of enzymes secreted by microorganisms and directed against the backbone and the side chains of plant cell wall polysaccharides. Among side chains degrading enzymes, the feruloyl esterase A (FAEA) specifically removes feruloyl residues. Thus, FAEA has potential applications in a wide range of industrial processes such as paper bleaching or bio-ethanol production. To gain insight into FAEA hydrolysis activity, we solved its crystal structure. In this paper, we report how the use of four consecutive factorial approaches (two incomplete factorials, one sparse matrix, and one full factorial) allowed expressing in Escherichia coli, refolding and then crystallizing Aspergillus niger FAEA in 6 weeks. Culture conditions providing the highest expression level were determined using an incomplete factorial approach made of 12 combinations of four E. coli strains, three culture media and three temperatures (full factorial: 36 combinations). Aspergillus niger FAEA was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. These were dissolved using a chaotropic agent, and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni column under denaturing conditions. A suitable buffer for refolding the protein eluted from the Ni column was found using a second incomplete factorial approach made of 96 buffers (full factorial: 3840 combinations). After refolding, the enzyme was further purified by gel filtration, and then crystallized following a standard protocol: initial crystallization conditions were found using commercial crystallization screens based on a sparse matrix. Crystals were then optimized using a full factorial screen. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Polymethoxylated flavonoids occur in a number of plant families, including the Lamiaceae. To date, the metabolic pathways giving rise to the diversity of these compounds have not been studied. Analysis of our expressed sequence tag database for four sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) lines afforded identification of candidate flavonoid O-methyltransferase genes. Recombinant proteins displayed distinct substrate preferences and product specificities that can account for all detected 7-/6-/4'-methylated, 8-unsubstituted flavones. Their biochemical specialization revealed only certain metabolic routes to be highly favorable and therefore likely in vivo. Flavonoid O-methyltransferases catalyzing 4'- and 6-O-methylations shared high identity (approximately 90{\%}), indicating that subtle sequence changes led to functional differentiation. Structure homology modeling suggested the involvement of several amino acid residues in defining the proteins' stringent regioselectivities. The roles of these individual residues were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, revealing two discrete mechanisms as a basis for the switch between 6- and 4'-O-methylation of two different substrates. These findings delineate major pathways in a large segment of the flavone metabolic network and provide a foundation for its further elucidation.},

However, a variety of other ion sources are either currently in use to evaluate natural products or show significant future promise. This review discusses these various ion sources in the context of other articles in this special issue, but is also applicable to other fields of analysis, including materials science. Ion sources are grouped based on the current understanding of their predominant ion formation mechanisms. This broad overview groups ion sources into the following categories: electron ionization and single photon ionization; chemical ionization-like and plasma-based; electrospray ionization; and, laser desorption-based. Laser desorption-based methods are emphasized with specific examples given for laser desorption postionization sources and their use in the analysis of intact microbial biofilms. Brief consideration is given to the choice of ion source for various sample types and analyses, including MS imaging.},

The enzyme catalyzes methylation of lambda-DNA, a 50-kilobase pair linear molecule with multiple M.MspI-specific sites, with a specificity constant (kcat/KM) of 0.9 x 10(8) M-1 s-1. But the values of the specificity constants for the smaller DNA substrates (121 and 1459 base pairs (bp)) with single methylation target or with multiple targets (sonicated lambda-DNA) were less by an order of magnitude. Product inhibition of the M.MspI-catalyzed methylation reaction by methylated DNA is competitive with respect to DNA and noncompetitive with respect to S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). The S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibition of the methylation reaction is competitive with respect to AdoMet and uncompetitive with respect to DNA. The presteady state kinetic analysis showed a burst of product formation when AdoMet was added to the enzyme preincubated with the substrate DNA. The burst is followed by a constant rate of product formation (0.06 mol per mol of enzyme s-1) which is similar to catalytic constants (kcat = approximately 0.056 s-1) measured under steady state conditions. The isotope exchange in chasing the labeled methyltransferase-DNA complex with unlabeled DNA and AdoMet leads to a reduced burst as compared with the one involving chase with labeled DNA and AdoMet. The enzyme is capable of exchanging tritium at C-5 of target cytosine in the substrate DNA in the absence of cofactor AdoMet. The kinetic data are consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism for the M.MspI-catalyzed DNA methylation where DNA binds first.},

PKMTs are likely to have many additional substrates in addition to histones, but relatively few nonhistone substrates have been characterized, and the substrate specificity for many PKMTs has yet to be defined. Thus, new unbiased methods are needed to find PKMT substrates. Here, we describe a chemical biology approach for unbiased, proteome-wide identification of novel PKMT substrates. Our strategy makes use of an alkyne-bearing S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) analogue, which is accepted by the PKMT, SETDB1, as a cofactor, resulting in the enzymatic attachment of a terminal alkyne to its substrate. Such labeled proteins can then be treated with azide-functionalized probes to ligate affinity handles or fluorophores to the PKMT substrates. As a proof-of-concept, we have used SETDB1 to transfer the alkyne moiety from the SAM analogue onto a recombinant histone H3 substrate. We anticipate that this chemical method will find broad use in epigenetics to enable unbiased searches for new PKMT substrates by using recombinant enzymes and unnatural SAM cofactors to label and purify many substrates simultaneously from complex organelle or cell extracts.},

Methyl transfer to the substrate requires reductive cleavage of a second equivalent of SAM. Crystal structures of RlmN and RlmN with SAM show that a single molecule of SAM coordinates the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Residue Cys(355) is S-methylated and located proximal to the SAM methyl group, suggesting the SAM that is involved in the initial methyl transfer binds at the same site. Thus, RlmN accomplishes its complex reaction with structural economy, harnessing the two most important reactivities of SAM within a single site.},

abstract = {Posttranslational methylation by S-adenosyl-L-methionine(SAM)-dependent methyltransferases plays essential roles in modulating protein function in both normal and disease states. As such, there is a growing need to develop chemical reporters to examine the physiological and pathological roles of protein methyltransferases. Several sterically bulky SAM analogues have previously been used to label substrates of specific protein methyltransferases. However, broad application of these compounds has been limited by their general incompatibility with native enzymes. Here we report a SAM surrogate, ProSeAM (propargylic Se-adenosyl-l-selenomethionine), as a reporter of methyltransferases. ProSeAM can be processed by multiple protein methyltransferases for substrate labeling. In contrast, sulfur-based propargylic SAM undergoes rapid decomposition at physiological pH, likely via an allene intermediate. In conjunction with fluorescent/affinity-based azide probes, copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition chemistry, in-gel fluorescence visualization and proteomic analysis, we further demonstrated ProSeAM's utility to profile substrates of endogenous methyltransferases in diverse cellular contexts. These results thus feature ProSeAM as a convenient probe to study the activities of endogenous protein methyltransferases.},

The binding of the dye to protein causes a shift in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 to 595 nm, and it is the increase in absorption at 595 nm which is monitored. This assay is very reproducible and rapid with the dye binding process virtually complete in approximately 2 min with good color stability for 1 hr. There is little or no interference from cations such as sodium or potassium nor from carbohydrates such as sucrose. A small amount of color is developed in the presence of strongly alkaline buffering agents, but the assay may be run accurately by the use of proper buffer controls. The only components found to give excessive interfering color in the assay are relatively large amounts of detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton X-100, and commercial glassware detergents. Interference by small amounts of detergent may be eliminated by the use of proper controls.},

abstract = {General thermodynamic calculations using the semiempiric PM3 method have led to the conclusion that prenyldiphosphate converting enzymes require at least one divalent metal cation for the activation and cleavage of the diphosphate-prenyl ester bond, or they must provide structural elements for the efficient stabilization of the intermediate prenyl cation. The most important common structural features, which guide the product specificity in both terpene synthases and aromatic prenyl transferases are aromatic amino acid side chains, which stabilize prenyl cations by cation-pi: interactions. In the case of aromatic prenyl transferases, a proton abstraction from the phenolic hydroxyl group of the second substrate will enhance the electron density in the phenolic ortho-position at which initial prenylation of the aromatic compound usually occurs. A model of the structure of the integral transmembrane-bound aromatic prenyl transferase UbiA was developed, which currently represents the first structural insight into this group of prenylating enzymes with a fold different from most other aromatic prenyl transferases. Based on this model, the structure-activity relationships and mechanistic aspects of related proteins, for example those of Lithospermum erythrorhizon or the enzyme AuaA from Stigmatella aurantiaca involved in the aurachin biosynthesis, were elucidated. The high similarity of this group of aromatic prenyltransferases to 5-epi-aristolochene synthase is an indication of an evolutionary relationship with terpene synthases (cyclases). This is further supported by the conserved DxxxD motif found in both protein families. In contrast, there is no such relationship to the aromatic prenyl transferases with an ABBA-fold, such as NphB, or to any other known family of prenyl converting enzymes. Therefore, it is possible that these two groups might have different evolutionary ancestors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved},

abstract = {The antioxidant and prooxidant behavior of flavonoids and the related activity-structure relationships were investigated in this study using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay. Three different reactive species were used in the assay: 2,2′-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride, a peroxyl radical generator; Cu2+-H2O2, mainly a hydroxyl radical generator; and Cu2+, a transition metal. Flavonoids including flavones, isoflavones, and flavanones acted as antioxidants against peroxyl and hydroxyl radicals and served as prooxidants in the presence of Cu2+. Both the antioxidant and the copper-initiated prooxidant activities of a flavonoid depend upon the number of hydroxyl substitutions in its backbone structure, which has neither antioxidant nor prooxidant action. In general, the more hydroxyl substitutions, the stronger the antioxidant and prooxidant activities. The flavonoids that contain multiple hydroxyl substitutions showed antiperoxyl radical activities several times stronger than Trolox, an $\alpha$-tocopherol analogue. The single hydroxyl substitution at position 5 provides no activity, whereas the di-OH substitution at 3′ and 4′ is particularly important to the peroxyl radical absorbing activity of a flavonoid. The conjugation between rings A and B does not affect the antioxidant activity but is very important for the copper-initiated prooxidant action of a flavonoid. The O-methylation of the hydroxyl substitutions inactivates both the antioxidant and the prooxidant activities of the flavonoids.Copyright © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) was developed for the determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids in a medicinal Chinese herb Taraxacum formosanum Kitam. Initially, both phenolic acids and flavonoids were extracted with 50{\%} ethanol in a water-bath at 60 °C for 3 h and eventually separated into acidic fraction and neutral fraction by using a C(18) cartridge. A total of 29 compounds were separated within 68 min by employing a Gemini C(18) column and a gradient solvent system of 0.1{\%} formic acid and acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Based on the retention behavior as well as absorption and mass spectra, 19 phenolic acids and 10 flavonoids were identified and quantified in T. formosanum, with the former ranging from 14.1 $\mu$g/g to 10,870.4 $\mu$g/g, and the latter from 9.9 $\mu$g/g to 325.8 $\mu$g/g. For further identification of flavonoids, a post-column derivatization method involving shift reagents such as sodium acetate or aluminum chloride was used and the absorption spectral characteristics without or with shift reagents were compared. An internal standard syringic acid was used for quantitation of phenolic acids, whereas (±) naringenin was found suitable for quantitation of flavonoids. The developed LC-MS/MS method showed high reproducibility, as evident from the relative standard deviation (RSD) values for intra-day and inter-day variability being 1.0-6.8{\%} and 2.0-7.7{\%} for phenolic acids and 3.7-7.4{\%} and 1.5-8.1{\%} for flavonoids, respectively, and thus may be applied for simultaneous determination of phenolic acids and flavonoids in Chinese herb and nutraceuticals.},

abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

abstract = {In plants, type I and II S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferases (OMTs) catalyze most hydroxyl group methylations of small molecules. A homology-based RT-PCR strategy using Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) RNA previously identified six new type I plant OMT family members. We now describe the molecular and biochemical characterization of a seventh protein. It shares 56-58{\%} identity with caffeic acid OMTs (COMTs), but it failed to methylate COMT substrates, and had no activity with flavonoids. However, the in vitro incubations revealed unusually high background levels without added substrates. A search for the responsible component revealed that the enzyme methylated dithiothreitol (DTT), the reducing agent added for enzyme stabilization. Unexpectedly, product analysis revealed that the methylation occurred on a sulfhydryl moiety, not on a hydroxyl group. Analysis of 34 compounds indicated a broad substrate range, with a preference for small hydrophobic molecules. Benzene thiol (Km 220 microm) and furfuryl thiol (Km 60 microm) were the best substrates (6-7-fold better than DTT). Small isosteric hydrophobic substrates with hydroxyl groups, like phenol and guaiacol, were also methylated, but the activities were at least 5-fold lower than with thiols. The enzyme was named C. roseus S-methyltransferase 1 (CrSMT1). Models based on the COMT crystal structure suggest that S-methylation is mechanistically identical to O-methylation. CrSMT1 so far is the only recognized example of an S-methyltransferase in this protein family. Its properties indicate that a few changes in key residues are sufficient to convert an OMT into a S-methyltransferase (SMT). Future functional investigations of plant methyltransferases should consider the possibility that the enzymes may direct methylation at sulfhydryl groups.},

abstract = {The protein methyltransferases (PMT) constitute a large and important class of enzymes that catalyze site-specific methylation of lysine or arginine residues on histones and other proteins. Site-specific histone methylation is a critical component of chromatin regulation of gene transcription-a pathway that is often genetically altered in human cancers. Oncogenic alterations (e.g., mutations, chromosomal translocations, and others) of PMTs, or of associated proteins, have been found to confer unique dependencies of cancer cells on the activity of specific PMTs. Examples of potent, selective small-molecule inhibitors of specific PMTs are reviewed that have been shown to kill cancers cells bearing such oncogenic alterations, while having minimal effect on proliferation of nonaltered cells. Selective inhibitors of the PMTs, DOT1L and EZH2, have entered phase I clinical studies and additional examples of selective PMT inhibitors are likely to enter the clinic soon. The current state of efforts toward clinical testing of selective PMT inhibitors as personalized cancer therapeutics is reviewed here.},

abstract = {The use of and search for drugs and dietary supplements derived from plants have accelerated in recent years. Ethnopharmacologists, botanists, microbiologists, and natural-products chemists are combing the Earth for phytochemicals and "leads" which could be developed for treatment of infectious diseases. While 25 to 50{\%} of current pharmaceuticals are derived from plants, none are used as antimicrobials. Traditional healers have long used plants to prevent or cure infectious conditions; Western medicine is trying to duplicate their successes. Plants are rich in a wide variety of secondary metabolites, such as tannins, terpenoids, alkaloids, and flavonoids, which have been found in vitro to have antimicrobial properties. This review attempts to summarize the current status of botanical screening efforts, as well as in vivo studies of their effectiveness and toxicity. The structure and antimicrobial properties of phytochemicals are also addressed. Since many of these compounds are currently available as unregulated botanical preparations and their use by the public is increasing rapidly, clinicians need to consider the consequences of patients self-medicating with these preparations.},

abstract = {The actinomycin biosynthetic gene cluster of Streptomyces chrysomallus harbors two paralogous genes, acmI and acmL, encoding methyltransferases. To unveil their suspected role in the formation of 3-hydroxy-4-methyl-anthranilic acid (4-MHA), the building block of the actinomycin chromophore, each gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. Testing the resulting ∼40 kDa His(6)-tagged proteins with compounds of biogenetic relevance as substrates and S-adenosyl-l-methionine revealed that each exclusively methylated 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) with formation of 3-hydroxy-4-methylkynurenine (4-MHK) identified by its in vitro conversion to 4-MHA with hydroxykynureninase. AcmI and AcmL methylate also hydroxyphenyl-amino propanoic acids such as p-tyrosine, m-tyrosine, or 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (DOPA) but at a lower rate than 3-HK. The presence of the $\alpha$-amino group was necessary for substrate recognition. Phenolic acids with shorter chains such as 4-hydoxyphenyl-l-glycine (HPG), 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HB), or 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HA) gave no product. Both enzymes were stereospecific for the optical configuration at $\alpha$-C with unprecedented antipodal selectivity for the d-enantiomer of 3-HK and the l-enantiomer of p-tyrosine or m-tyrosine. AcmI and AcmL show sequence similarity to various C- and O-methyltransferases from bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis places them into the clade of C-methyltransferases comprising among others orthologues involved in 4-MHA formation of other biosynthesis systems and methyltransferases putatively involved in the C-methylation of tyrosine. Remarkably, computational remodelling of AcmI and AcmL structures revealed significant similarity with the 3-D structures of type 1 O-methyltransferases from plants such as caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) and other phenylpropanoid methyltransferases. The relevance of 3-HK or 3-HA methylation in the actinomycin biosynthesis pathways of different actinomycetes is discussed.},

abstract = {Flavonoids are ubiquitous in photosynthesising cells and are commonly found in fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems, flowers, tea, wine, propolis and honey. For centuries, preparations containing these compounds as the principal physiologically active constituents have been used to treat human diseases. Increasingly, this class of natural products is becoming the subject of anti-infective research, and many groups have isolated and identified the structures of flavonoids possessing antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activity. Moreover, several groups have demonstrated synergy between active flavonoids as well as between flavonoids and existing chemotherapeutics. Reports of activity in the field of antibacterial flavonoid research are widely conflicting, probably owing to inter- and intra-assay variation in susceptibility testing. However, several high-quality investigations have examined the relationship between flavonoid structure and antibacterial activity and these are in close agreement. In addition, numerous research groups have sought to elucidate the antibacterial mechanisms of action of selected flavonoids. The activity of quercetin, for example, has been at least partially attributed to inhibition of DNA gyrase. It has also been proposed that sophoraflavone G and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate inhibit cytoplasmic membrane function, and that licochalcones A and C inhibit energy metabolism. Other flavonoids whose mechanisms of action have been investigated include robinetin, myricetin, apigenin, rutin, galangin, 2,4,2′-trihydroxy-5′-methylchalcone and lonchocarpol A. These compounds represent novel leads, and future studies may allow the development of a pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial agent or class of agents.},

abstract = {Developing new green solvents is one of the key subjects in Green Chemistry. Ionic liquids (ILs) and deep eutectic solvents, thus, have been paid great attention to replace current harsh organic solvents and have been applied to many chemical processing such as extraction and synthesis. However, current ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents have still limitations to be applied to a real chemical industry due to toxicity against human and environment and high cost of ILs and solid state of most deep eutectic solvents at room temperature. Recently we discovered that many plant abundant primary metabolites changed their state from solid to liquid when they were mixed in proper ratio. This finding made us hypothesize that natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) play a role as alternative media to water in living organisms and tested a wide range of natural products, which resulted in discovery of over 100 NADES from nature. In order to prove deep eutectic feature the interaction between the molecules was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. All the tested NADES show clear hydrogen bonding between components. As next step physical properties of NADES such as water activity, density, viscosity, polarity and thermal properties were measured as well as the effect of water on the physical properties. In the last stage the novel NADES were applied to the solubilization of wide range of biomolecules such as non-water soluble bioactive natural products, gluten, starch, and DNA. In most cases the solubility of the biomolecules evaluated in this study was greatly higher than water. Based on the results the novel NADES may be expected as potential green solvents at room temperature in diverse fields of chemistry. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Genes related to these OMTs from the model legume Medicago truncatula cluster as separate branches of the type I plant small molecule OMT family. To better understand the possible functions of these related OMTs in secondary metabolism in M. truncatula, seven of the OMTs were expressed in E. coli, purified, and their in vitro substrate preferences determined. Many of the enzymes display promiscuous activities, and some exhibit dual regio-specificity for the 4' and 7-hydroxyl moieties of the isoflavonoid nucleus. Protein structure homology modeling was used to help rationalize these catalytic activities. Transcripts encoding the different OMT genes exhibited differential tissue-specific and infection- or elicitor-induced expression, but not always in parallel with changes in expression of confirmed genes of the isoflavonoid pathway. The results are discussed in relation to the potential in vivo functions of these OMTs based on our current understanding of the phytochemistry of M. truncatula, and the difficulties associated with gene annotation in plant secondary metabolism.},

The assay is based on the competition of the phospholipids for the Fe3+ ion in the purple-colored Fe(III)-$\gamma$-resorcylate complex and for other cations. To compare the binding affinities of several cation-phospholipid interactions, K0.5 values were derived from binding curves constructed by determination of the absorbance of the Fe(III)-$\gamma$-resorcylate at 490 nm as a function of the cation concentration. The assay was used to analyze the binding of lanthanide ions, calcium ions, and amines (hydrochlorides of ethanolamine, spermidine, and hexyltrimethylammonium chloride) to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and mixed micelles containing anionic lipids such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl-p-nitrophenol. The method was evaluated by fluorescence measurements with Eu3+ ions as tracer. Lanthanide ions such as La3+ and Ce3+ ions showed K0.5 values smaller by one to two orders of magnitude compared with Ca2+ ions. In the presence of increasing amounts of detergents such as Triton X-100, the method also reflected transitions from SUVs to micelles. The binding capacity for metal ions was higher for phospholipid-containing micelles than for the corresponding SUVs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In both mammalian and microbial species, B12-dependent methionine synthase catalyzes methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4folate) to homocysteine. The B12 (cobalamin) cofactor plays an essential role in this reaction, accepting the methyl group from CH3-H4folate to form methylcob(III)alamin and in turn donating the methyl group to homocysteine to generate methionine and cob(I)alamin. Occasionally the highly reactive cob(I)alamin intermediate is oxidized to the catalytically inactive cob(II)alamin form. Reactivation to sustain enzyme activity is achieved by a reductive methylation, requiring S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor and, in Esherichia coli, flavodoxin as an electron donor. The intact system is controlled and organized so that AdoMet, rather than methyltetrahydrofolate, is the methyl donor in the reactivation reaction. AdoMet is not wasted as a methyl donor in the catalytic cycle in which methionine is synthesized from homocysteine. The structures of the AdoMet binding site and the cobalamin-binding domains (previously determined) provide a starting point for understanding the methyl transfer reactions of methionine synthase. RESULTS: We report the crystal structure of the 38 kDa C-terminal fragment of E.coli methionine synthase that comprises the AdoMet-binding site and is essential for reactivation. The structure, which includes residues 901-1227 of methionine synthase, is a C-shaped single domain whose central feature is a bent antiparallel betasheet. Database searches indicate that the observed polypeptide has no close relatives. AdoMet binds near the center of the inner surface of the domain and is held in place by both side chain and backbone interactions. CONCLUSIONS: The conformation of bound AdoMet, and the interactions that determine its binding, differ from those found in other AdoMet-dependent enzymes. The sequence Arg-x-x-x-Gly-Tyr is critical for the binding of AdoMet to methionine synthase. The position of bound AdoMet suggests that large areas of the C-terminal and cobalamin-binding fragments must come in contact in order to transfer the methyl group of AdoMet to cobalamin. The catalytic and activation cycles may be turned off and on by alternating physical separation and approach of the reactants.},

Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.},

abstract = {Current cloning technologies based on site-specific recombination are efficient, simple to use, and flexible, but have the drawback of leaving recombination site sequences in the final construct, adding an extra 8 to 13 amino acids to the expressed protein. We have devised a simple and rapid subcloning strategy to transfer any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence. With proper design of the cleavage sites, two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site. Based on this property, a cloning strategy called 'Golden Gate' cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation. This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct, thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation.},

Up to the present day numerous review articles and guide books on the subject have been published. This review article focuses on the current applications and limitations of the modern mass spectrometry techniques, especially in combination with electrospray ionisation (ESI), an ionisation method which is most commonly applied in metabolomics studies. As a possible alternative to ESI, perspectives on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) in metabolomics studies are introduced, a method which still is not widespread in the field. In metabolomics studies the results must always be interpreted in the context of the applied sampling procedures as well as data analysis. Different sampling strategies are introduced and the importance of data analysis is illustrated in the example of metabolic network modelling.},

The significance of any anomalous signal may be assessed by probability and correlation analysis. The algorithms used by the CCP4 scaling program SCALA are described. A requirement for the scaling and merging of intensities is knowledge of the Laue group and point-group symmetries: the possible symmetry of the diffraction pattern may be determined from scores such as correlation coefficients between observations which might be symmetry-related.

abstract = {Eleven naturally occurring flavonoid aglycones, belonging to the representative flavone, flavonol, and flavanone types were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed on-line with negative ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). In order to resolve the MS/MS spectra obtained, each compound was reinvestigated by direct loop injections using an ion trap mass spectrometer. The MSn spectra obtained allowed us to propose plausible schemes for their fragmentation supported by the analysis of five complementary synthetic flavonoid aglycones. The negative ion ESI-MS/MS behavior of the different aglycones investigated in this study revealed interesting differences when compared with the previously described patterns obtained using various ionization techniques in positive ion. Thus, concerning the retro Diels-Alder (RDA) fragmentation pathways, several structurally informative anions appeared highly specific of the negative ion mode. In addition, a new lactone-type structure, instead of a ketene, was proposed for a classic RDA diagnostic ion. We also observed unusual CO, CO2, and C3O2 losses which appear to be characteristic of the negative ion mode. All these results and these unusual neutral losses show that the negative ion mode was a powerful complementary tool of the positive ion mode for the structural characterization of flavonoid aglycones by ESI-MS/MS.

It produces chalcone by condensing one p-coumaroyl- and three malonyl-coenzyme A thioesters into a polyketide reaction intermediate that cyclizes. The crystal structures of CHS alone and complexed with substrate and product analogs reveal the active site architecture that defines the sequence and chemistry of multiple decarboxylation and condensation reactions and provides a molecular understanding of the cyclization reaction leading to chalcone synthesis. The structure of CHS complexed with resveratrol also suggests how stilbene synthase, a related enzyme, uses the same substrates and an alternate cyclization pathway to form resveratrol. By using the three-dimensional structure and the large database of CHS-like sequences, we can identify proteins likely to possess novel substrate and product specificity. The structure elucidates the chemical basis of plant polyketide biosynthesis and provides a framework for engineering CHS-like enzymes to produce new products.},

abstract = {This work shows that quantitative multivariate modeling is an emerging possibility for unraveling protein-protein interactions using a combination of designed mutations with sequence and structure information. Using this approach, it is possible to stereochemically determine which residue properties contribute most to the interaction. This is illustrated by results from modeling of the interaction of the wild-type and 17 single and double mutants of a camel antibody specific for lysozyme. Linear multivariate models describing association and dissociation rates as well as affinity were developed. Sequence information in the form of amino acid property scales was combined with 3D structure information (obtained using molecular mechanics calculations) in the form of coordinates of the alpha-carbons and the center of the side chains. The results show that in addition to the amino acid properties of the mutated residues 101 and 105, the dissociation rate is controlled by the side-chain coordinate of residue 105, whereas the association is determined by the coordinates of residues 99, 100, 105 (side chain), 111, and 112. The great difference between the models for association and dissociation rates illustrates that the event of molecular recognition and the property of binding stability rely on different physical processes.},

abstract = {(L)-Arginine hydrochloride (Arg HCl) has been used for protein refolding as a universal aggregation suppressor for monomeric proteins. This paper presents an investigation of the refolding of tetrameric beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) using Arg HCl and other salts. In a binary system using only Arg HCl, the refolding yield of beta-gal increased with increasing concentration up to 0.2 M. However, the refolding yield sharply decreased above this concentration, reaching the level below the control yield of 5{\%} at 0.5 M and near zero above 0.75 M, an observation unexpected from monomeric proteins. In a ternary system using both 0.2 M Arg HCl and another salt, the refolding yield increased up to 1.5-fold higher than that in the binary system. These data indicate that aggregation suppressive effects of protein increase with Arg HCl concentration, but also are deleterious to self-association of the protein. This dual nature of Arg HCl effects may have to be taken into account in its application for refolding of oligomeric proteins.},

There is wide interest in a range of medical and dietary applications, and having a rapid, reliable method for structural elucidation is essential. In this study a range of flavonoid standards are investigated by chip-based negative ion nanospray mass spectrometry. It was found that the different classes of flavonoid studied have a combination of distinct neutral losses from the precursor ion [M-H](-) along with characteristic low-mass ions. By looking only for this distinct pattern of product ions, it is possible to determine the class of flavonoid directly. This methodology is tested here by the analysis of a green tea extract, where the expected flavonoids were readily identified, along with quercetin, which is shown to be present at only about 2{\%} of the most intense ion in the spectrum.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of human phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (hPNMT) reveals a disulfide-linked dimer, despite the presence of reducing agent in the crystallisation conditions. By removing the reducing agent, hPNMT crystals grow more rapidly and at lower protein concentrations. However, it was unclear whether the disulfide bonds are only present in the crystal form or whether these affect enzyme activity. The solution oligomeric state of hPNMT was investigated using biochemical techniques and activity assays. We found that in the absence of reducing agent, hPNMT forms dimers in solution. Furthermore, the solution dimer of hPNMT incorporates disulfide bonds, since this form is sensitive to reducing agent. The C48A and C139A mutants of hPNMT, which are incapable of forming the disulfide bond observed in the crystal structure, have a decreased propensity to form dimer in solution. Those dimers that do form are also sensitive to reducing agent. Further, the C48A/C139A double mutant shows only monomeric behaviour. Both dimeric and monomeric hPNMT, as well as mutants have wildtype enzyme activity. These results show that a variety of disulfides, including those observed in the crystal structure, can form in solution. In addition, disulfide-linked dimers are as active as the monomeric enzyme indicating that the crystal structure of the protein is a valid target for inhibitor design.

Medicago species synthesize a variety of bioactive natural products that are used to engage into symbiotic interactions but also serve to deter pathogens and herbivores. For humans, these bioactive natural products often possess promising pharmaceutical properties. In this review, we focus on the two most interesting and well characterized secondary metabolite classes found in Medicago species, the triterpene saponins and the flavonoids, with a detailed overview of their biosynthesis, regulation, and profiling methods. Furthermore, their biological role within the plant as well as their potential utility for human health or other applications is discussed. Finally, we give an overview of the advances made in metabolic engineering in Medicago species and how the development of novel molecular and omics toolkits can influence a better understanding of this genus in terms of specialized metabolism and chemistry. Throughout, we critically analyze the current bottlenecks and speculate on future directions and opportunities for research and exploitation of Medicago metabolism.},

abstract = {Quantitative study of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions in solution requires accurate determination of protein concentration. Often, for proteins available only in "molecular biological" amounts, it is difficult or impossible to make an accurate experimental measurement of the molar extinction coefficient of the protein. Yet without a reliable value of this parameter, one cannot determine protein concentrations by the usual uv spectroscopic means. Fortunately, knowledge of amino acid residue sequence and promoter molecular weight (and thus also of amino acid composition) is generally available through the DNA sequence, which is usually accurately known for most such proteins. In this paper we present a method for calculating accurate (to +/- 5{\%} in most cases) molar extinction coefficients for proteins at 280 nm, simply from knowledge of the amino acid composition. The method is calibrated against 18 "normal" globular proteins whose molar extinction coefficients are accurately known, and the assumptions underlying the method, as well as its limitations, are discussed.},

The analysis involves 186 independent experiments performed on 136 ligands binding to 10 biological receptors and, for comparison, to DNA and to two different enzymes. AHo and ASo values correlate according to the regression equation AHo (kcal mol-') = -9.5 1515 correlating equation is of the form AHo = BASo and is expected for a case of enthalpy-entropy compensation with a compensation temperature p = 278 K. The AH-AS correlation is carefully examined in terms of transmission of the experimental errors and of the representativeness of the experimental sample utilized. The correlation can be considered a true physical constraint for which, in spite of the relatively wide intervals of AHo and ASo allowed, the drug-receptor dissociation constant, KD, can never be smaller than some 10 pM. The physicochemical origin of the AH-hs compensation is probably related to an intrinsic property of the hydrogen bond, which is the main force determining the association of the participants (drug, receptor binding site, water) in the drug-receptor binding equilibrium.},

abstract = {The S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent methylation of adenine 58 in the T-loop of tRNAs is essential for cell growth in yeast or for adaptation to high temperatures in thermophilic organisms. In contrast to bacterial and eukaryotic tRNA m(1)A58 methyltransferases that are site-specific, the homologous archaeal enzyme from Pyrococcus abyssi catalyzes the formation of m(1)A also at the adjacent position 57, m(1)A57 being a precursor of 1-methylinosine. We report here the crystal structure of P. abyssi tRNA m(1)A57/58 methyltransferase ((Pab)TrmI), in complex with S-adenosyl-L-methionine or S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine in three different space groups. The fold of the monomer and the tetrameric architecture are similar to those of the bacterial enzymes. However, the inter-monomer contacts exhibit unique features. In particular, four disulfide bonds contribute to the hyperthermostability of the archaeal enzyme since their mutation lowers the melting temperature by 16.5°C. His78 in conserved motif X, which is present only in TrmIs from the Thermococcocales order, lies near the active site and displays two alternative conformations. Mutagenesis indicates His78 is important for catalytic efficiency of (Pab)TrmI. When A59 is absent in tRNA(Asp), only A57 is modified. Identification of the methylated positions in tRNAAsp by mass spectrometry confirms that (Pab)TrmI methylates the first adenine of an AA sequence.},

abstract = {The chirality of biologically active S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) is S,S, where the designations refer to the sulfur and the alpha-carbon, respectively. This paper describes a cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for separating (S,S)-AdoMet from the biologically inactive (R,S)-AdoMet that results from racemization at the sulfur. This method was used to measure the rates of the degradation reactions of (S,S)-AdoMet as a function of pH. These reactions and the first-order rate constants, which were found at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5, are racemization, 1.8 X 10(-6) s-1; cleavage to homoserine lactone and 5'-(methylthio)adenosine, 4.6 X 10(-6) s-1; and hydrolysis to adenine and S-pentosylmethionine, 3 X 10(-6) s-1. Racemization showed no change in rate over the pH range from 7.5 to 1.5. The cleavage reaction persisted until the pH was lowered to 1.5, but hydrolysis ceased at pH 6. Commercial samples of nonradioactive AdoMet contained 20-30{\%} (R,S)-AdoMet, while a sample of [methyl-3H]AdoMet had less than 1{\%} (R,S)-AdoMet. Preparing enzyme substrates by mixing such samples will cause an underestimate of specific activity and an overestimate of the amount of product. The (R,S)-AdoMet/(S,S)-AdoMet ratio in mouse liver was 0.03, much less than the value of 0.19 calculated from the above rate constants. An enzyme extract from mouse liver did not degrade (R,S)-AdoMet, but a more thorough search may find such an activity. In any event, the cleavage and hydrolysis reactions partially balance the racemization of (S,S)-AdoMet in vivo and prevent excessive accumulation of (R,S)-AdoMet.},

abstract = {S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-based methylation is integral to metabolism and signaling. AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases belong to multiple distinct classes and share a catalytic mechanism that arose through convergent evolution; however, fundamental determinants underlying this shared methyl transfer mechanism remain undefined. A survey of high-resolution crystal structures reveals that unconventional carbon-oxygen (CH···O) hydrogen bonds coordinate the AdoMet methyl group in different methyltransferases irrespective of their class, active site structure, or cofactor binding conformation. Corroborating these observations, quantum chemistry calculations demonstrate that these charged interactions formed by the AdoMet sulfonium cation are stronger than typical CH···O hydrogen bonds. Biochemical and structural studies using a model lysine methyltransferase and an active site mutant that abolishes CH···O hydrogen bonding to AdoMet illustrate that these interactions are important for high-affinity AdoMet binding and transition-state stabilization. Further, crystallographic and NMR dynamics experiments of the wild-type enzyme demonstrate that the CH···O hydrogen bonds constrain the motion of the AdoMet methyl group, potentially facilitating its alignment during catalysis. Collectively, the experimental findings with the model methyltransferase and structural survey imply that methyl CH···O hydrogen bonding represents a convergent evolutionary feature of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, mediating a universal mechanism for methyl transfer.},

abstract = {4-Coumaric acid:CoA ligase (4CL) is the central enzyme of the plant-specific phenylpropanoid pathway. It catalyzes the synthesis of hydroxycinnamate-CoA thioesters, the precursors of lignin and other important phenylpropanoids, in two-step reactions involving the formation of hydroxycinnamate-AMP anhydride and then the nucleophilic substitution of AMP by CoA. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of Populus tomentosa 4CL1 in the unmodified (apo) form and in forms complexed with AMP and adenosine 5'-(3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl)phosphate (APP), an intermediate analog, at 2.4, 2.5, and 1.9 {\AA} resolution, respectively. 4CL1 consists of two globular domains connected by a flexible linker region. The larger N-domain contains a substrate binding pocket, while the C-domain contains catalytic residues. Upon binding of APP, the C-domain rotates 81° relative to the N-domain. The crystal structure of 4CL1-APP reveals its substrate binding pocket. We identified residues essential for catalytic activities (Lys-438, Gln-443, and Lys-523) and substrate binding (Tyr-236, Gly-306, Gly-331, Pro-337, and Val-338) based on their crystal structures and by means of mutagenesis and enzymatic activity studies. We also demonstrated that the size of the binding pocket is the most important factor in determining the substrate specificities of 4CL1. These findings shed light on the enzymatic mechanisms of 4CLs and provide a solid foundation for the bioengineering of these enzymes.},

In this review, we focus on four recently developed methods for the detection and investigation of small molecules, namely MetFrag/MetFusion, ISIS, FingerID, and FT-BLAST. These methods have the potential to significantly advance the field of computational mass spectrometry for the research of natural products. For example, they may help with the dereplication of compounds at an early stage of the drug discovery process; that is, the detection of molecules that are identical or highly similar to known drugs or drug leads. Furthermore, when a potential drug lead has been determined, these tools may help to identify it and elucidate its structure.},

abstract = {Upon irradiation with elevated light intensities, the ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) accumulates a complex pattern of methylated and glycosylated flavonol conjugates in the upper epidermal layer. Identification of a flavonol methylating activity, partial purification of the enzyme, and sequencing of the corresponding peptide fragments revealed a novel S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that was specific for flavonoids and caffeoyl-CoA. Cloning and functional expression of the corresponding cDNA verified that the new methyltransferase is a multifunctional 26.6-kDa Mg(2+)-dependent enzyme, which shows a significant sequence similarity to the cluster of caffeoyl coenzyme A-methylating enzymes. Functional analysis of highly homologous members from chickweed (Stellaria longipes), Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) demonstrated that the enzymes from the ice plant, chickweed, and A. thaliana possess a broader substrate specificity toward o-hydroquinone-like structures than previously anticipated for Mg(2+)-dependent O-methyltransferases, and are distinctly different from the tobacco enzyme. Besides caffeoyl-CoA and flavonols, a high specificity was also observed for caffeoylglucose, a compound never before reported to be methylated by any plant O-methyltransferase. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence and differences in acceptor specificities among both animal and plant O-methyltransferases, we propose that the enzymes from the Centrospermae, along with the predicted gene product from A. thaliana, form a novel subclass within the caffeoyl coenzyme A-dependent O-methyltransferases, with potential divergent functions not restricted to lignin monomer biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Plant S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferases (SAM-Mtases) are the key enzymes in phenylpropanoid, flavonoid and many other metabolic pathways of biotechnological importance. Here we compiled the amino acid sequences of 56 SAM-Mtases from different plants and performed a computer analysis for the conserved sequence motifs that could possibly act as SAM-binding domains. To date, genes or cDNAs encoding at least ten distinct groups of SAM-Mtases that utilize SAM and a variety of substrates have been reported from higher plants. Three amino acid sequence motifs are conserved in most of these SAM-Mtases. In addition, many conserved domains have been discovered in each group of O-methyltransferases (OMTs) that methylate specific substrates and may act as sites for substrate specificity in each enzyme. Finally, a diagrammatic representation of the relationship between different OMTs is presented. These SAM-Mtase sequence signatures will be useful in the identification of SAM-Mtase motifs in the hitherto unidentified proteins as well as for designing primers in the isolation of new SAM-Mtases from plants.},

abstract = {Electrospray operated in the negative mode was used to analyse methoxylated flavonoids. They were found to produce radical anions by collision-induced fragmentation of the aglycones. Loss of a methyl group from the deprotonated molecule corresponding to [M - H - 15]-* ions, as well as [M - H - 15-28]-* and [M - H - 15-29]- fragment ions, were found to constitute the characteristic fragmentation for the monomethoxylated species, whereas [M - H - 15]-*, [M - H - 30]- and [M - H - 30-28]- were predominant for the polymethoxylated species. Obtained under similar conditions, the product-ion spectra of isomeric compounds were characteristically different. It is therefore possible to distinguish between methoxylated flavonoids with identical molecular mass, e.g. when screening plant extracts for flavonoid composition. However, comparison with standard compounds is necessary for the identification of unknown flavonoid aglycones.},

abstract = {The vertebrate olfactory system discriminates a wide variety of odorants by relaying coded information from olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium to olfactory cortical areas of the brain. Recent studies have shown that the first step in odor discrimination is mediated by approximately 1000 distinct olfactory receptors, which comprise the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, we used Ca(2+) imaging and single-cell reverse transcription-PCR techniques to identify mouse olfactory neurons responding to an odorant and subsequently to clone a receptor gene from the responsive cell. The functionally cloned receptors were expressed in heterologous systems, demonstrating that structurally related olfactory receptors recognized overlapping sets of odorants with distinct affinities and specificities. Our results provide direct evidence for the existence of a receptor code in which the identities of different odorants are specified by distinct combinations of odorant receptors that possess unique molecular receptive ranges. We further demonstrate that the receptor code for an odorant changes with odorant concentration. Finally, we show that odorant receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells couple to stimulatory G-proteins such as Galphaolf, resulting in odorant-dependent increases in cAMP. Odor discrimination is thus determined by differences in the receptive ranges of the odorant receptors that together encode specific odorant molecules.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methylated resveratrol analogs show similar biological activities that are comparable with those of the resveratrol. However, the methylated resveratrol analogs exhibit better bioavailability as they are more easily transported into the cell and more resistant to degradation. Although these compounds are widely used in human health care and in industrial materials, at present they are mainly obtained by extraction from raw plant sources. Accordingly their production can suffer from a variety of economic problems, including low levels of productivity and/or heterogeneous quality. On this backdrop, large-scale production of plant metabolites via microbial approaches is a promising alternative to chemical synthesis and extraction from plant sources.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: An Escherichia coli system containing an artificial biosynthetic pathway that produces methylated resveratrol analogues, such as pinostilbene (3,4'-dihydroxy-5-methoxystilbene), 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene, 3,4'-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene, and 3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene, from simple carbon sources is developed. These artificial biosynthetic pathways contain a series of codon-optimized O-methyltransferase genes from sorghum in addition to the resveratrol biosynthetic genes. The E. coli cells that harbor pET-opTLO1S or pET-opTLO3S produce the one-methyl resveratrol analogues of 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene and pinostilbene, respectively. Furthermore, the E. coli cells that harbor pET-opTLO13S produce 3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxystilbene, bis-methyl resveratrol (3,4'-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene), and tri-methyl resveratrol (3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our strategy demonstrates the first harness microorganisms for de novo synthesis of methylated resveratrol analogs used a single vector system joined with resveratrol biosynthetic genes and sorghum two resveratrol O-methyltransferase genes. Thus, this is also the first report on the production of the methylated resveratrol compounds bis-methyl and tri-methyl resveratrol (3,4'-dimethoxy-5-hydroxystilbene and 3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene) in the E. coli culture. Thus, the production of the methylated resveratrol compounds was performed on the simple E. coli medium without precursor feeding in the culture.},

For three decades, considerable research effort has been devoted to the development of reliable in situ regeneration methods for the most commonly employed cofactors, particularly NADH and NADPH. Today, researchers can choose from a plethora of options, and oxidoreductases are routinely employed even on industrial scale. Nevertheless, more efficient cofactor regeneration methods are still being developed, with the aim of achieving better atom economy, simpler reaction setups, and higher productivities. Besides, cofactor dependence has been recognized as an opportunity to confer novel reactivity upon enzymes by engineering their cofactors, and to couple (redox) biotransformations in multi-enzyme cascade systems. These novel concepts will help to further establish cofactor-dependent biotransformations as an attractive option for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, chiral building blocks, and bio-based platform molecules.},

abstract = {Stilbenes are bioactive compounds that show beneficial effects for humans, such as anti-tumor activity and survival improvement. Resveratrol, a representative of stilbenes and showing various health-improving activities, is rapidly metabolized in humans, and modified resveratrols are therefore desired as anti-cancer drugs and dietary polyphenols. An Escherichia coli system, in which an artificial stilbene biosynthetic pathway, including steps of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, and stilbene synthase, was reconstructed, produced stilbenes in high yields: resveratrol from tyrosine and pinosylvin from phenylalanine. To incorporate a stilbene methyltransferase gene into this E. coli system, cDNA of Os08g06100 in Oryza sativa was expressed and its O-methylating activity toward stilbenes was confirmed. Incorporation of the pinosylvin methyltransferase (OsPMT) gene into the pathway established in E. coli led to production of mono- and di-methylated stilbenes. Furthermore, the OsPMT gene turned out to be useful in production of unnatural stilbene methyl ethers due to its rather relaxed substrate specificity; various carboxylic acids supplemented as precursors, such as p-fluorocinnamic acid, 3-(2-furyl)acrylic acid, 3-(2-thienyl)acrylic acid, and 3-(3-pyridyl)acrylic acid, to the E. coli system carrying the steps of 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, stilbene synthase, and OsPMT were converted to stilbene dimethyl ethers with the corresponding carboxylic moiety.},

abstract = {Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil (Narcissus spp.), snowdrop (Galanthus spp.), and summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum). Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor in the development of synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant O-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 4'-O-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 4'-O-methyltransferase (NpN4OMT) of the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway.},

SOMT-2 could convert apigenin, daidzein, genistein, and quercetin into the corresponding 4???-O-methylated compounds such as acacetin, formononetin, biochanine A, and 4???-methylated quercetin whereas naringenin turned out to be the best substrate tested. SOMT-2 stoichiometically converted naringenin (4???,5,7-trihyroxyflavanone) into a ponciretin (4???-methoxy-5,7-dihydroxyflavanone), whose structure was determined by NMR and LC/mass spectral analyses. Considering the reactions, SOMT-2 may have a regiospecific methylation activity, resulting in transforming 4???-hydroxyl group of flavonoids B-ring to 4???-methyl group. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Sakuranetin inhibits germination of Magnaporthe grisea, and ponciretin is a potential inhibitor of Helicobacter pylori. To achieve this, we reconstructed the naringenin biosynthesis pathway in E. coli. First, the shikimic acid pathway, which leads to the biosynthesis of tyrosine, was engineered in E. coli to increase the amount of available tyrosine. Second, several genes for the biosynthesis of ponciretin and sakuranetin such as tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumaroyl CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and O-methyltransferase (OMT) were overexpressed. In order to increase the supply the Coenzyme A (CoA), one gene (icdA, isocitrate dehydrogenase) was deleted. Using these strategies, we synthesized ponciretin and sakuranetin from glucose in E. coli at the concentration of 42.5 mg/L and 40.1 mg/L, respectively.},

The DNA is located in a cleft between the two domains of the protein and has the characteristic conformation of B-form DNA, except for a disrupted G-C base pair that contains the target cytosine. The cytosine residue has swung completely out of the DNA helix and is positioned in the active site, which itself has undergone a large conformational change. The DNA is contacted from both the major and the minor grooves, but almost all base-specific interactions between the enzyme and the recognition bases occur in the major groove, through two glycine-rich loops from the small domain. The structure suggests how the active nucleophile reaches its target, directly supports the proposed mechanism for cytosine-5 DNA methylation, and illustrates a novel mode of sequence-specific DNA recognition.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flavonoids comprise a large family of secondary plant metabolic intermediates that exhibit a wide variety of antioxidant and human health-related properties. Plant production of flavonoids is limited by the low productivity and the complexity of the recovered flavonoids. Thus to overcome these limitations, metabolic engineering of specific pathway in microbial systems have been envisaged to produce high quantity of a single molecules.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULT: Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce the key intermediate flavonoid, naringenin, solely from glucose. For this, specific naringenin biosynthesis genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were selected by comparative expression profiling and introduced in S. cerevisiae. The sole expression of these A. thaliana genes yielded low extracellular naringenin concentrations (<5.5 $\mu$M). To optimize naringenin titers, a yeast chassis strain was developed. Synthesis of aromatic amino acids was deregulated by alleviating feedback inhibition of 3-deoxy-d-arabinose-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (Aro3, Aro4) and byproduct formation was reduced by eliminating phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Aro10, Pdc5, Pdc6). Together with an increased copy number of the chalcone synthase gene and expression of a heterologous tyrosine ammonia lyase, these modifications resulted in a 40-fold increase of extracellular naringenin titers (to approximately 200 $\mu$M) in glucose-grown shake-flask cultures. In aerated, pH controlled batch reactors, extracellular naringenin concentrations of over 400 $\mu$M were reached.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results reported in this study demonstrate that S. cerevisiae is capable of de novo production of naringenin by coexpressing the naringenin production genes from A. thaliana and optimization of the flux towards the naringenin pathway. The engineered yeast naringenin production host provides a metabolic chassis for production of a wide range of flavonoids and exploration of their biological functions.},

While the primary activity of these class I enzymes is methylation of caffeoyl coenzyme A OMTs, a distinct subset is able to methylate a wider range of substrates, characterized by the promiscuous phenylpropanoid and flavonoid OMT. The observed broad substrate specificity resides in two regions: the N-terminus and a variable insertion loop near the C-terminus, which displays the lowest degree of sequence conservation between the two subfamilies. Structural and biochemical data, based on site-directed mutagenesis and domain exchange between the two enzyme types, present evidence that only small topological changes among otherwise highly conserved 3-D structures are sufficient to differentiate between an enzymatic generalist and an enzymatic specialist in plant natural product methylation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The coding sequence of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 slr0095 gene was cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli. The corresponding enzyme was classified as a cation- and S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase (SynOMT), consistent with considerable amino acid sequence identities to eukaryotic O-methyltransferases (OMTs). The substrate specificity of SynOMT was similar with those of plant and mammalian CCoAOMT-like proteins accepting a variety of hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids as substrates. In contrast to the known mammalian and plant enzymes, which exclusively methylate the meta-hydroxyl position of aromatic di- and trihydroxy systems, Syn-OMT also methylates the para-position of hydroxycinnamic acids like 5-hydroxyferulic and 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamic acid, resulting in the formation of novel compounds. The x-ray structure of SynOMT indicates that the active site allows for two alternative orientations of the hydroxylated substrates in comparison to the active sites of animal and plant enzymes, consistent with the observed preferred para-methylation and position promiscuity. Lys3 close to the N terminus of the recombinant protein appears to play a key role in the activity of the enzyme. The possible implications of these results with respect to modifications of precursors of polymers like lignin are discussed.},

abstract = {Covering: up to the end of 2013 The in-depth analysis of secondary metabolomes of many microbes offers tremendous opportunities for the discovery of novel natural products which often exhibit promising biological activities. However, over the last years the increasing availability of whole-genome information has led to raised expectations, as bioinformatic analysis revealed that traditional strategies to discover novel secondary metabolites apparently have so far only scratched the surface of the real microbial "secondary metabolome landscape". Metabolomics-based approaches using modern mass spectrometry techniques can help to bridge the gap between genome-encoded potential for the production of secondary metabolites and the usually contradictory low numbers of compounds known from a specific producer. In this article recent studies are highlighted in which metabolomics-driven analysis played a crucial role for the discovery of novel secondary metabolites from microbial sources. We also exemplify how the implementation of metabolomics techniques facilitates the structural characterization of novel metabolites and contributes to the in-depth investigation of underlying biosynthetic pathways. Furthermore, the constantly increasing role of secondary metabolomics for the identification of novel natural products in a drug discovery context is discussed.},

Only two structural folds, GT-A and GT-B, have been identified for the nucleotide sugar-dependent enzymes, but other folds are now appearing for the soluble domains of lipid phosphosugar-dependent glycosyl transferases. Structural and kinetic studies have provided new insights. Inverting glycosyltransferases utilize a direct displacement S(N)2-like mechanism involving an enzymatic base catalyst. Leaving group departure in GT-A fold enzymes is typically facilitated via a coordinated divalent cation, whereas GT-B fold enzymes instead use positively charged side chains and/or hydroxyls and helix dipoles. The mechanism of retaining glycosyltransferases is less clear. The expected two-step double-displacement mechanism is rendered less likely by the lack of conserved architecture in the region where a catalytic nucleophile would be expected. A mechanism involving a short-lived oxocarbenium ion intermediate now seems the most likely, with the leaving phosphate serving as the base.},

We present the first crystal structure of a Radical SAM enzyme, that of HemN, the Escherichia coli oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase, at 2.07 A resolution. HemN catalyzes the essential conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX during heme biosynthesis. HemN binds a 4Fe-4S cluster through three cysteine residues conserved in all Radical SAM enzymes. A juxtaposed SAM coordinates the fourth Fe ion through its amide nitrogen and carboxylate oxygen. The SAM sulfonium sulfur is near both the Fe (3.5 A) and a neighboring sulfur of the cluster (3.6 A), allowing single electron transfer from the 4Fe-4S cluster to the SAM sulfonium. SAM is cleaved yielding a highly oxidizing 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. HemN, strikingly, binds a second SAM immediately adjacent to the first. It may thus successively catalyze two propionate decarboxylations. The structure of HemN reveals the cofactor geometry required for Radical SAM catalysis and sets the stage for the development of inhibitors with antibacterial function due to the uniquely bacterial occurrence of the enzyme.},

Despite the progress in genomics, structural proteomics, and computational biology, functional annotation of methyltransferases remains a challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis and activity of a new AdoMet analogue functionalized with a ketone group. Using catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT, EC 2.1.1.6) and thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT, EC 2.1.1.67) as model enzymes, this robust and readily accessible analogue displays kinetic parameters that are comparable to AdoMet and exhibits multiple turnovers with enzyme. More importantly, this AdoMet surrogate displays the same substrate specificity as the natural methyl donor. Incorporation of the ketone group allows for subsequent modification via bio-orthogonal labeling strategies and sensitive detection of the tagged ketone products. Hence, this AdoMet analogue expands the toolbox available to interrogate the biochemical functions of methyltransferases.},

abstract = {Searchable MS/MS spectra libraries, constructed using the results of liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with data-dependent acquisition on an ion trap mass spectrometer, are presented with regard to the identification and confirmation of a variety of closely related flavonoids in a set of biological samples. Flavonoids were found to exhibit a maximum amount of structurally specific MS/MS spectra at 45{\%} of normalized collision energy on the instrument used, without wideband activation. These MS/MS spectra were then searched automatically against a 297-substance MS/MS library that contains many previously acquired spectra of standard flavonoids. The possible applications of this powerful technique to biological samples are also discussed. Daidzein and genistein were identified through the MS/MS spectra library while searching through LC/MS/MS data for plant and microbial extracts. Moreover, these compounds proved completely distinguishable from other flavonoids of closely related structures in the MS/MS spectra library, using the NIST MS search program. The applicability of the library-searchable spectra at low concentrations was demonstrated by successful identification of daidzein and genistein at 0.05 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively.},

abstract = {Flavones are plant secondary metabolites with potent pharmacological properties. We report the functional expression of FSI, a flavonoid 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase-encoding flavone synthase from parsley in Escherichia coli. This expression allows the biosynthesis of various flavones from phenylpropanoid acids in recombinant E. coli strains simultaneously expressing five plant-specific flavone biosynthetic genes. The gene ensemble consists of 4CL-2 (4-coumarate:CoA ligase) and FSI (flavone synthase I) from parsley, chsA (chalcone synthase) and chiA (chalcone isomerase) from Petunia hybrida, and OMT1A (7-O-methyltransferase) from peppermint. After a 24-h cultivation, the recombinant E. coli produces significant amounts of apigenin (415 microg/l), luteolin (10 microg/l), and genkwanin (208 microg/l). The majority of the flavone products are excreted in the culture media; however, 25{\%} is contained within the cells. The metabolic engineering strategy presented demonstrates that plant-specific flavones are successfully produced in E. coli for the first time by incorporating a soluble flavone synthase confined only in Apiaceae.},

In sensory studies flavanones homoeriodictyol (1), its sodium salt (1-Na), sterubin (2), and eriodictyol (4) could significantly decrease the bitter taste of caffeine without exhibiting intrinsic strong flavors or taste characteristics. Further investigations on 1-Na elicited a broad masking activity between 10 and 40{\%} toward different chemical classes of bitter molecules (e.g. salicin, amarogentin, paracetamol, quinine) but not toward bitter linoleic acid emulsions. For caffeine and amarogentin, dose-response studies were performed; the masking activity toward bitter taste for both compounds reached a plateau at higher concentrations of 1-Na. Due to these facts, homoeriodictyol sodium salt (1-Na) seems to be a very interesting new taste modifier for food applications and pharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {Interactions at the binding interface of biomolecular complexes are often mediated by ordered water molecules. In this work, we considered two concanavalin A-carbohydrate complexes. In the first, a water molecule is buried at the binding interface. In the second, this water molecule is displaced by a modification of the ligand (Clarke, C.; Woods, R. J.; Gluska, J.; Cooper, A.; Nutley, M. A.; Boons, G. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 12238-12247). We computed the contribution of this water molecule to the thermodynamic properties using statistical mechanical formulas for the energy and entropy and molecular dynamics simulations. Other contributions to the binding affinity, including desolvation, entropy of conformational restriction, and interaction between the ligand and protein, were also computed. The thermodynamic consequences of displacement of the ordered water molecule by ligand modification were in qualitative agreement with experimental data. The free energy contribution of the water molecule (-17.2 kcal/mol; -19.2 enthalpic and +2 entropic) was nearly equivalent to the additional protein-ligand interactions in trimannoside 2 (-18.9 kcal/mol). The two structural ions interact more strongly with the water than with the hydroxyl of trimannoside 2, thus favoring trimannoside 1. The contributions from desolvation and conformational entropy are much smaller but significant, compared to the binding free energy difference. The picture that emerges is that the final outcome of water displacement is sensitive to the details of the binding site and cannot be predicted by simple empirical rules.},

abstract = {The field of metabolomics has become increasingly important in the context of functional genomics. Together with other ”omics“ data, the investigation of the metabolome is an essential part of systems biology. Beside the analysis of human and animal biofluids, the investigation of the microbial physiology by methods of metabolomics has gained increased attention. For example, the analysis of metabolic processes during growth or virulence factor expression is crucially important to understand pathogenesis of bacteria. Common bioanalytical techniques for metabolome analysis include liquid and gas chromatographic methods coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS and GC-MS) and spectroscopic approaches such as NMR. In order to achieve metabolome data representing the physiological status of a microorganism, well-verified protocols for sampling and analysis are necessary. This chapter presents a detailed protocol for metabolome analysis of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. A detailed manual for cell sampling and metabolite extraction is given, followed by the description of the analytical procedures GC-MS and LC-MS. The advantages and limitations of each experimental setup are discussed. Here, a guideline specified for S. aureus metabolomics and information for important protocol steps are presented, to avoid common pitfalls in microbial metabolome analysis.},

Computational methodology for the rule-based Moriguchi Log P (MLogP) calculation is described. Turbidimetric solubility measurement is described and applied to known drugs. High throughput screening (HTS) leads tend to have higher MWT and Log P and lower turbidimetric solubility than leads in the pre-HTS era. In the development setting, solubility calculations focus on exact value prediction and are difficult because of polymorphism. Recent work on linear free energy relationships and Log P approaches are critically reviewed. Useful predictions are possible in closely related analog series when coupled with experimental thermodynamic solubility measurements.},

abstract = {The addition of a methyl moiety to a small chemical is a common transformation in the biosynthesis of natural products across all three domains of life. These methylation reactions are most often catalysed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (MTs). MTs are categorized based on the electron-rich, methyl accepting atom, usually O, N, C, or S. SAM-dependent natural product MTs (NPMTs) are responsible for the modification of a wide array of structurally distinct substrates, including signalling and host defense compounds, pigments, prosthetic groups, cofactors, cell membrane and cell wall components, and xenobiotics. Most notably, methylation modulates the bioavailability, bioactivity, and reactivity of acceptor molecules, and thus exerts a central role on the functional output of many metabolic pathways. Our current understanding of the structural enzymology of NPMTs groups these phylogenetically diverse enzymes into two MT-superfamily fold classes (class I and class III). Structural biology has also shed light on the catalytic mechanisms and molecular bases for substrate specificity for over fifty NPMTs. These biophysical-based approaches have contributed to our understanding of NPMT evolution, demonstrating how a widespread protein fold evolved to accommodate chemically diverse methyl acceptors and to catalyse disparate mechanisms suited to the physiochemical properties of the target substrates. This evolutionary diversity suggests that NPMTs may serve as starting points for generating new biocatalysts.},

abstract = {Circular dichroism (CD) is a spectroscopic technique commonly used to investigate the structure of proteins. Major secondary structure types, alpha-helices and beta-strands, produce distinctive CD spectra. Thus, by comparing the CD spectrum of a protein of interest to a reference set consisting of CD spectra of proteins of known structure, predictive methods can estimate the secondary structure of the protein. Currently available methods, including K2D2, use such experimental CD reference sets, which are very small in size when compared to the number of tertiary structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Conversely, given a PDB structure, it is possible to predict a theoretical CD spectrum from it. The methodological framework for this calculation was established long ago but only recently a convenient implementation called DichroCalc has been developed. In this study, we set to determine whether theoretically derived spectra could be used as reference set for accurate CD based predictions of secondary structure. We used DichroCalc to calculate the theoretical CD spectra of a nonredundant set of structures representing most proteins in the PDB, and applied a straightforward approach for predicting protein secondary structure content using these theoretical CD spectra as reference set. We show that this method improves the predictions, particularly for the wavelength interval between 200 and 240 nm and for beta-strand content. We have implemented this method, called K2D3, in a publicly accessible web server at http://www. ogic.ca/projects/k2d3. Proteins 2011. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Marine bacteria are the most widely distributed organisms in the ocean environment and produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites. However, traditional screening for bioactive natural compounds is greatly hindered by the lack of a systematic way of cataloguing the chemical profiles of bacterial strains found in nature. Here we present a chemical fingerprint database of marine bacteria based on their secondary metabolite profiles, acquired by high-resolution LC-MS. Till now, 1,430 bacterial strains spanning 168 known species collected from different marine environments were cultured and profiled. Using this database, we demonstrated that secondary metabolite profile similarity is approximately, but not always, correlated with taxonomical similarity. We also validated the ability of this database to find species-specific metabolites, as well as to discover known bioactive compounds from previously unknown sources. An online interface to this database, as well as the accompanying software, is provided freely for the community to use.},

abstract = {Methyltransferases catalyze specific transfers of methyl groups from the ubiquitous cofactor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to various nucleophilic positions in biopolymers like DNA, RNA, and proteins. We had previously described synthesis and application of AdoMet analogues carrying sulfonium-bound 4-substituted but-2-ynyl side chains for transfer by methyltransferases. Although useful in certain applications, these cofactor analogues exhibited short lifetimes in physiological buffers. Examination of the reaction kinetics and products showed that their fast inactivation followed a different pathway than observed for AdoMet and rather involved a pH-dependent addition of a water molecule to the side chain. This side reaction was eradicated by synthesis of a series of cofactor analogues in which the separation between an electronegative group and the triple bond was increased from one to three carbon units. The designed hex-2-ynyl moiety-based cofactor analogues with terminal amino, azide, or alkyne groups showed a markedly improved enzymatic transalkylation activity and proved well suitable for methyltransferase-directed sequence-specific labeling of DNA in vitro and in bacterial cell lysates.},

abstract = {7-O-Methyl aromadendrin (7-OMA) is an aglycone moiety of one of the important flavonoid-glycosides found in several plants, such as Populus alba and Eucalyptus maculata, with various medicinal applications. To produce such valuable natural flavonoids in large quantity, an Escherichia coli cell factory has been developed to employ various plant biosynthetic pathways. Here, we report the generation of 7-OMA from its precursor, p-coumaric acid, in E. coli for the first time. Primarily, naringenin (NRN) (flavanone) synthesis was achieved by feeding p-coumaric acid and reconstructing the plant biosynthetic pathway by introducing the following structural genes: 4-coumarate-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase from Petroselinum crispum, chalcone synthase from Petunia hybrida, and chalcone isomerase from Medicago sativa. In order to increase the availability of malonyl-CoA, a critical precursor of 7-OMA, genes for the acyl-CoA carboxylase $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits (nfa9890 and nfa9940), biotin ligase (nfa9950), and acetyl-CoA synthetase (nfa3550) from Nocardia farcinica were also introduced. Thus, produced NRN was hydroxylated at position 3 by flavanone-3-hydroxylase from Arabidopsis thaliana, which was further methylated at position 7 to produce 7-OMA in the presence of 7-O-methyltransferase from Streptomyces avermitilis. Dihydrokaempferol (DHK) (aromadendrin) and sakuranetin (SKN) were produced as intermediate products. Overexpression of the genes for flavanone biosynthesis and modification pathways, along with malonyl-CoA overproduction in E. coli, produced 2.7 mg/liter (8.9 $\mu$M) 7-OMA upon supplementation with 500 $\mu$M p-coumaric acid in 24 h, whereas the strain expressing only the flavanone modification enzymes yielded 30 mg/liter (99.2 $\mu$M) 7-OMA from 500 $\mu$M NRN in 24 h.},

The utility of QSARs for biodegradation has been evaluated in the light of various physicochemical, quantum, and molecular descriptors and biodegradation parameters. It has been suggested that further development of successful QSARs for biodegradation should involve the establishment of large and consistent biodegradation data bases and the identification descriptors that can relate well to the mechanisms and rate limiting processes in the biodegradation sequence. Among the descriptors studied, the quantum chemical‐type descriptors appear to be most promising for the development of QSARs for the prediction of biodegradability of environmental pollutants.},

abstract = {Methylation of the toxic metalloid arsenic is widespread in nature. Members of every kingdom have arsenic(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransferase enzymes, which are termed ArsM in microbes and AS3MT in animals, including humans. Trivalent arsenic(III) is methylated up to three times to form methylarsenite [MAs(III)], dimethylarsenite [DMAs(III)] and the volatile trimethylarsine [TMAs(III)]. In microbes, arsenic methylation is a detoxification process. In humans, MAs(III) and DMAs(III) are more toxic and carcinogenic than either inorganic arsenate or arsenite. Here, new crystal structures are reported of ArsM from the thermophilic eukaryotic alga Cyanidioschyzon sp. 5508 (CmArsM) with the bound aromatic arsenicals phenylarsenite [PhAs(III)] at 1.80 A resolution and reduced roxarsone [Rox(III)] at 2.25 A resolution. These organoarsenicals are bound to two of four conserved cysteine residues: Cys174 and Cys224. The electron density extends the structure to include a newly identified conserved cysteine residue, Cys44, which is disulfide-bonded to the fourth conserved cysteine residue, Cys72. A second disulfide bond between Cys72 and Cys174 had been observed previously in a structure with bound SAM. The loop containing Cys44 and Cys72 shifts by nearly 6.5 A in the arsenic(III)-bound structures compared with the SAM-bound structure, which suggests that this movement leads to formation of the Cys72-Cys174 disulfide bond. A model is proposed for the catalytic mechanism of arsenic(III) SAM methyltransferases in which a disulfide-bond cascade maintains the products in the trivalent state.},

The use of elevated cone voltages permitted observation of product ion mass spectra of selected primary and secondary fragment ions so that each fragment ion reported was observed as a direct product of its immediate precursor ion.

abstract = {Due to the increasing understanding of the health benefits and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids, there continues to be significant effort dedicated to improved analytical methods for characterizing the structures of flavonoids and monitoring their levels in fruits and vegetables, as well as developing new approaches for mapping the interactions of flavonoids with biological molecules. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), particularly in conjunction with liquid chromatography (LC), is the dominant technique that has been pursued for elucidation of flavonoids. Metal complexation strategies have proven to be especially promising for enhancing the ionization of flavonoids and yielding key diagnostic product ions for differentiation of isomers. Of particular value is the addition of a chromophoric ligand to allow the application of infrared (IR) multiphoton dissociation as an alternative to collision-induced dissociation (CID) for the differentiation of isomers. CID, including energy-resolved methods, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have also been utilized widely for structural characterization of numerous classes of flavonoids and development of structure/activity relationships.The gas-phase ion chemistry of flavonoids is an active area of research particularly when combined with accurate mass measurement for distinguishing between isobaric ions. Applications of a variety of ab initio and chemical computation methods to the study of flavonoids have been reported, and the results of computations of ion and molecular structures have been shown together with computations of atomic charges and ion fragmentation. Unambiguous ion structures are obtained rarely using MS alone. Thus, it is necessary to combine MS with spectroscopic techniques such as ultraviolet (UV) and NMR to achieve this objective. The application of NMR data to the mass spectrometric examination of flavonoids is discussed.},

The activity of the PNMT-IMER and its applicability for on-line N-methylation of normetanephrine was investigated. The reactor was connected through a switching valve to a cyano (CN) and ODS stationary phase connected in series. The substrate was injected onto the PNMT-IMER and the unreacted substrate and product were eluted and transported via a switching valve onto the analytical columns. The results from the PNMT-IMER/CN-ODS chromatographic system demonstrate that the enzyme retained its catalytic activity. Known substrates and inhibitors for PNMT were examined and the chromatographic system was utilized to carry out both quantitative and qualitative determinations. The PNMT-IMER/ CN-ODS system proves to be useful in basic biochemical studies, an ideal for the high throughput screening of substances for PNMT substrate-inhibitor properties.

abstract = {Adenosine is undoubtedly an ancient biological molecule that is a component of many enzyme cofactors: ATP, FADH, NAD(P)H, and coenzyme A, to name but a few, and, of course, of RNA. Here we present an overview of the role of adenosine in its most reactive form: as an organic radical formed either by homolytic cleavage of adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B(12), AdoCbl) or by single-electron reduction of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) complexed to an iron-sulfur cluster. Although many of the enzymes we discuss are newly discovered, adenosine's role as a radical cofactor most likely arose very early in evolution, before the advent of photosynthesis and the production of molecular oxygen, which rapidly inactivates many radical enzymes. AdoCbl-dependent enzymes appear to be confined to a rather narrow repertoire of rearrangement reactions involving 1,2-hydrogen atom migrations; nevertheless, mechanistic insights gained from studying these enzymes have proved extremely valuable in understanding how enzymes generate and control highly reactive free radical intermediates. In contrast, there has been a recent explosion in the number of radical-AdoMet enzymes discovered that catalyze a remarkably wide range of chemically challenging reactions; here there is much still to learn about their mechanisms. Although all the radical-AdoMet enzymes so far characterized come from anaerobically growing microbes and are very oxygen sensitive, there is tantalizing evidence that some of these enzymes might be active in aerobic organisms including humans.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have given access to a large choice of live imaging techniques and have thereby profoundly modified our view of plant cells. Together with technological improvement of imaging, they have opened the possibility to monitor physico-chemical changes within cells. For this purpose, a new generation of FPs has been engineered. For instance, pHluorin, a point mutated version of green fluorescent protein, allows to get local pH estimates. In this paper, we will describe how genetically encoded sensors can be used to measure pH in the microenvironment of living tissues and subsequently discuss the role of pH in (i) exocytosis, (ii) ion uptake by plant roots, (iii) cell growth, and (iv) protein trafficking.},

abstract = {Molecular replacement (MR) generally becomes more difficult as the number of components in the asymmetric unit requiring separate MR models (i.e. the dimensionality of the search) increases. When the proportion of the total scattering contributed by each search component is small, the signal in the search for each component in isolation is weak or non-existent. Maximum-likelihood MR functions enable complex asymmetric units to be built up from individual components with a ;tree search with pruning' approach. This method, as implemented in the automated search procedure of the program Phaser, has been very successful in solving many previously intractable MR problems. However, there are a number of cases in which the automated search procedure of Phaser is suboptimal or encounters difficulties. These include cases where there are a large number of copies of the same component in the asymmetric unit or where the components of the asymmetric unit have greatly varying B factors. Two case studies are presented to illustrate how Phaser can be used to best advantage in the standard ;automated MR' mode and two case studies are used to show how to modify the automated search strategy for problematic cases.},

abstract = {In the last ten years, there has been an important increase in interest in quercetin action as a unique antioxidant, but its putative role in numerous prooxidant effects is also being continually updated. The mechanism underlying this undesirable ability seems to involve its metabolic oxidoreductive activation. Based on the structural properties of quercetin, we have investigated whether its catechol moiety may be the potential tool for revealed toxicity. We demonstrated, with an ESR spin-stabilization technique coupled to conventional spectrophotometry, that o-semiquinone and o-quinone are indeed the products of enzymatically catalyzed oxidative degradation of quercetin. The former radical might serve to facilitate the formation of superoxide and depletion of GSH, which could confer a specificity of its prooxidative action in situ. The observed one-electron reduction of o-quinone may enrich the semiquinone pool, thereby magnifying its effect. The two-electron reduction of quinone can result in constant resupply of quercetin in situ, thereby also modulating another pathway of its known biological activities. We have also tried to see whether the intracellular oxidative degradation of quercetin can be confirmed under the controlled conditions of model monolayer cell cultures. The results are indicative of the intracellular metabolic activation of quercetin to o-quinone, the process which can be partially associated with the observed concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect of quercetin.},

The crystal structure of this 2′O-methyltransferase has been determined at 2.5 {\AA} resolution. RlmB consists of an N-terminal domain connected by a flexible extended linker to a catalytic C-terminal domain and forms a dimer in solution. The C-terminal domain displays a divergent methyltransferase fold with a unique knotted region, and lacks the classic AdoMet binding site features. The N-terminal domain is similar to ribosomal proteins L7 and L30, suggesting a role in 23S rRNA recognition. The conserved residues in this novel family of 2′O-methyltransferases cluster in the knotted region, suggesting the location of the catalytic and AdoMet binding sites.},

abstract = {A study of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves phenolome was carried out during cold acclimation of the winter (Claire) and spring (Bounty) varieties using a combination of HPLC-ESI-MS techniques. A total of 40 phenolic and flavonoid compounds were identified, and consisted mainly of two coumarin derivatives, eight simple phenolic derivatives, 10 hydroxycinnamoyl amides and 20 flavonoid derivatives. Identification and quantification of individual compounds were performed using an HPLC system coupled with a photodiode array detector and two different ESI-MS systems, in combination with a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) technique. The analyses indicated that, although there were no qualitative differences in their profiles, the winter variety exhibited a higher phenolic content compared to the spring variety when both were grown under non-acclimated (control) conditions. Cold acclimation, on the other hand, resulted in a significant differential accumulation of phenolic compounds in both varieties: mostly as luteolin C-glycosides and their O-methyl derivatives in the winter variety (Claire) and a derivative of hydroxycinnamoyl amide in the spring variety (Bounty). These compounds accumulated in relatively large amounts in the apoplastic compartment. The accumulation of the O-methylated derivatives was associated with a marked increase in O-methyltransferase (OMT) activity. In addition, the trimethylated flavone, 3′,4′,5′- trimethyltricetin was identified for the first time in the native extracts of both control and cold-acclimated wheat leaves. The accumulation of a mixture of beneficial flavonoids, such as iso-orientin, vitexin and tricin in cold acclimated wheat leaves, attests for its potential as an inexpensive source of a health-promoting supplement to the human diet. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

LC/MS and LC/MS/MS techniques were used to detect and characterize the modified nucleoside as well as its cycloaddition product with a fluorescent azide.

Identification and quantitation of the main polyphenols were carried out by applying HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS methods. Representative samples of ripe olives were also analyzed at the same time to correlate, if possible, their polyphenolic profiles with those of the corresponding olive oil waste waters. The results demonstrate that Italian commercial olive oil waste waters were the richest in total polyphenolic compounds with amounts between 150 and 400 mg/100 mL of waste waters.

The time frame has been extended in both directions to include the 22 years from 1981 to 2002, and a new secondary subdivision related to the natural product source but applied to formally synthetic compounds has been introduced, using the concept of a "natural product mimic" or "NM" to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, the percentage of small molecule, new chemical entities that are nonsynthetic has remained at 62{\%} averaged over the whole time frame. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, particularly in the antihypertensive area, where of the 74 formally synthetic drugs, 48 can be traced to natural product structures/mimics. Similarly, with the 10 antimigraine drugs, seven are based on the serotonin molecule or derivatives thereof. Finally, although combinatorial techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact, been used in the optimization of a number of recently approved agents, we have not been able to identify a de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this time frame.},

abstract = {The 18-membered macrocyclic glycoside tiacumicin B, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, is of great therapeutic significance in treating Clostridium difficile infections. The recent characterization of the tiacumicin B biosynthetic gene cluster from Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subsp. hamdenensis NRRL 18085 revealed the functions of two glycosyltransferases, a C-methyltransferase, an acyltransferase, two cytochrome P450s, and a tailoring dihalogenase in tiacumicin biosynthesis. Here we report the genetic confirmation and biochemical characterization of TiaS5 as a sugar-O-methyltransferase, requisite for tiacumicin B biosynthesis. The tiaS5-inactivation mutant is capable of producing 14 tiacumicin analogues (11 of which are new), all lacking the 2'-O-methyl group on the internal rhamnose moiety. Notably, two tiacumicin analogues exhibit improved antibacterial properties. We have also biochemically verified TiaS5 as an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase, requiring divalent metal ions for activity. Substrate probing revealed TiaS5 to be a promiscuous enzyme, recognizing 12 tiacumicin analogues. These findings unequivocally establish that TiaS5 functions as a 2'-O-methyltransferase and provide direct biochemical evidence that TiaS5-catalyzed methylation is a tailoring step after glycosyl coupling in tiacumicin B biosynthesis.},

Herein, we describe the use of an N-mustard, 5'-(diaminobutyric acid)-N-iodoethyl-5'-deoxyadenosine ammonium hydrochloride (AAI), to generate a bisubstrate analogue inhibitor of PRMT1. Using the approach outlined in this communication, it should be possible to generate bisubstrate analogue-based inhibitors of PRMT isozymes that are potent and highly selective for a particular isozyme. The fact that PRMT1 catalyzes AAI transfer is also significant because with appropriate modifications (e.g., functionalization with pendant azido or alkyne functionalities) this compound could be used for proteomic applications to identify novel PRMT substrates.},

abstract = {The molecular-replacement method works well with good models and simple unit cells, but often fails with more difficult problems. Experience with likelihood in other areas of crystallography suggests that it would improve performance significantly. For molecular replacement, the form of the required likelihood function depends on whether there is ambiguity in the relative phases of the contributions from symmetry-related molecules (e.g. rotation versus translation searches). Likelihood functions used in structure refinement are appropriate only for translation (or six-dimensional) searches, where the correct translation will place all of the atoms in the model approximately correctly. A new likelihood function that allows for unknown relative phases is suitable for rotation searches. It is shown that correlations between sequence identity and coordinate error can be used to calibrate parameters for model quality in the likelihood functions. Multiple models of a molecule can be combined in a statistically valid way by setting up the joint probability distribution of the true and model structure factors as a multivariate complex normal distribution, from which the conditional distribution of the true structure factor given the models can be derived. Tests in a new molecular-replacement program, Beast, show that the likelihood-based targets are more sensitive and more accurate than previous targets. The new multiple-model likelihood function has a dramatic impact on success.},

Walnuts (Juglans regia L.) have been described previously as a rich source of polyphenols with a broad array of different structures. However, an accurate screening of its complete phenolic profile is still lacking. In the present work, liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization hybrid linear trap quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-LTQ-Orbitrap) was applied for a comprehensive identification of phenolic compounds in walnuts. A total of 120 compounds, including hydrolysable and condensed tannins, flavonoids and phenolic acids were identified or tentatively identified on the base of their retention times, accurate mass measurements and subsequent mass fragmentation data, or by comparing with reference substances and literature. The peak area of each signal in mass chromatograms was used to provide semiquantitative information for comparison purposes. The most abundant ions were observed for ellagitannins, ellagic acid and its derivatives. Furthermore, the high-resolution MS analysis revealed the presence of eight polyphenols that have never been reported in walnuts: stenophyllanin C, malabathrin A, eucalbanin A, cornusiin B, heterophylliin E, pterocarinin B, reginin A and alienanin B. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of newly discovered reactions within cofactor-dependent enzyme families increases continuously. A knowledge based categorization of cofactors with respect to their chemical properties shows that within enzymes they are not used for the catalysis of singular types of reactions and functionalities. Therefore, in many cases an unambiguous and narrow classification does not seem sufficient. Rather, the functional diversity of cofactors found in enzymes represents variations around specific themes with regard to a catalysed reaction and the cofactor chemistry. Furthermore, organic cofactor molecules are also used for non-enzymatic functions. Two representative cofactors are exemplarily discussed in detail, thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) as a self-sufficient cofactor and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), as both a catalytic and building-block-delivering cofactor. A further synopsis on selected examples of organic cofactors emphasizes the discovery and application of new enzymatic activities based on the cofactor-dependent chemistry and shows how bioinspired synthesis approaches expand catalytic and non-catalytic synthesis applications beyond natural solutions.},

The coding region of fgaMT was amplified by PCR from a cDNA library, cloned into pQE60, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. FgaMT comprises 339 amino acids with a molecular mass of about 38.1 kDa. The soluble dimeric His(6)-FgaMT was purified to near homogeneity and characterized biochemically. FgaMT was found to catalyze the N-methylation of 4-dimethylallyltryptophan in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine, resulting in the formation of 4-dimethylallyl-l-abrine, which was identified by NMR and mass spectrometry analysis. Therefore, FgaMT represents the second pathway-specific enzyme in the biosynthesis of ergot alkaloids. The enzyme did not require metal ions for its enzymatic reaction and showed a relatively high specificity toward the prenyl moiety at position C-4 of the indole ring. 4-Dimethylallyltryptophan derivatives with modification at the indole ring were also accepted by FgaMT as substrates. K(m) values for 4-dimethylallyltryptophan and S-adenosylmethionine were determined at 0.12 and 2.4 mm, respectively. The turnover number was 2.0 s(-1).},

Recent work has revealed how DNA methylation and chromatin structure are linked at the molecular level and how methylation anomalies play a direct causal role in tumorigenesis and genetic disease. Much new information has also come to light regarding the cellular methylation machinery, known as the DNA methyltransferases, in terms of their roles in mammalian development and the types of proteins they are known to interact with. This information has forced a new view for the role of DNA methyltransferases. Rather than enzymes that act in isolation to copy methylation patterns after replication, the types of interactions discovered thus far indicate that DNA methyltransferases may be components of larger complexes actively involved in transcriptional control and chromatin structure modulation. These new findings will likely enhance our understanding of the myriad roles of DNA methylation in disease as well as point the way to novel therapies to prevent or repair these defects.},

Maps of molecular electrostatic potential (MEPs) and molecular docking were used to investigate the interaction between ligands and the receptor (heme). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were employed to select the most important descriptors related to activity. The correlation between biological activity and molecular properties was obtained using the partial least squares and principal component regression methods. The regression PLS and PCR models built in this study were also used to predict the antimalarial activity of 30 new artemisinin compounds with unknown activity. The models obtained showed not only statistical significance but also predictive ability. The significant molecular descriptors related to the compounds with antimalarial activity were the hydration energy (HE), the charge on the O11 oxygen atom (QO11), the torsion angle O1-O2-Fe-N2 (D2) and the maximum rate of R/Sanderson Electronegativity (RTe+). These variables led to a physical and structural explanation of the molecular properties that should be selected for when designing new ligands to be used as antimalarial agents.},

Rutin oxidation reaction was followed by recording of spectral changes over the time at 360 nm. The studied oxidation is mostly enzymatic and less part non-enzymatic. The reaction with HRP has a higher rate compared with the reaction without of HRP, whereby is part of non-enzymatic reaction about 10{\%} of the total reaction. Kinetic parameters were determined from graphics of linear Michaelis-Menten equation, and it was found that investigated reactions of rutin oxidation by HRP take place in a ping-pong kinetic mechanism. High resolution HPLC-MS analysis of the mixture of oxidized products of rutin revealed the presence of rutin dimer. Because of widely distribution of rutin as well as presence of peroxidases and hydrogen peroxide in fresh foods identification of this enzymatic modification product can be beneficial for foods quality and safety. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, the characterization of unknown metabolites is challenging, since these cannot be assigned a candidate structure by using a reference database. In this case study, integrated LC-MS/MS based plant metabolomics allows us to detect several hundred metabolites in a sample; and integrated omics analyses,  e.g. , large-scale reverse genetics, linkage mapping, and association mapping, provides a powerful tool for candidate structure selection or rejection.

abstract = {The enzyme BchM (S-adenosyl-L-methionine:magnesium-protoporphyrin IX O-methyltransferase) from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyses an intermediate reaction in the bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathway. Overexpression of His(6)-tagged protein in Escherichia coli resulted in the majority of polypeptide existing as inclusion bodies. Purification from inclusion bodies was performed using metal-affinity chromatography after an elaborate wash step involving surfactant polysorbate-20. Initial enzymatic assays involved an in situ generation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine substrate using a crude preparation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase and this resulted in higher enzymatic activity compared with commercial S-adenosyl-L-methionine. A heat-stable stimulatory component present in the S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase was found to be a phospholipid, which increased enzymatic activity 3-4-fold. Purified phospholipids also stabilized enzymatic activity and caused a disaggregation of the protein to lower molecular mass forms, which ranged from monomeric to multimeric species as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. There was no stimulatory effect observed with magnesium-chelatase subunits on methyltransferase activity using His-BchM that had been stabilized with phospholipids. Substrate specificity of the enzyme was limited to 5-co-ordinate square-pyramidal metalloporphyrins, with magnesium-protoporphyrin IX being the superior substrate followed by zinc-protoporphyrin IX and magnesium-deuteroporphyrin. Kinetic analysis indicated a random sequential reaction mechanism. Three non-substrate metalloporphyrins acted as inhibitors with different modes of inhibition exhibited with manganese III-protoporphyrin IX (non-competitive or uncompetitive) compared with cobalt II-protoporphyrin IX (competitive).},

abstract = {Catharanthus roseus (Madagascar periwinkle) flavonoids have a simple methylation pattern. Characteristic are B-ring 5′ and 3′ methylations and a methylation in the position 7 of the A-ring. The first two can be explained by a previously identified unusual O-methyltransferase (CrOMT2) that performs two sequential methylations. We used a homology based RT-PCR strategy to search for cDNAs encoding the enzyme for the A-ring 7 position. Full-length cDNAs for three proteins were characterized (CrOMT5, CrOMT6, CrOMT7). The deduced polypeptides shared 59-66{\%} identity among each other, with CrOMT2, and with CrOMT4 (a previously characterized protein of unknown function). The five proteins formed a cluster separate from all other OMTs in a relationship tree. Analysis of the genes showed that all C. roseus OMTs had a single intron in a conserved position, and a survey of OMT genes in other plants revealed that this intron was highly conserved in evolution. The three cDNAs were cloned for expression of His-tagged recombinant proteins. CrOMT5 was insoluble, but CrOMT6 and CrOMT7 could be purified by affinity chromatography. CrOMT7 was inactive with all compounds tested. The only substrates found for CrOMT6 were 3′-O-methyl-eriodictyol (homoeriodictyol) and the corresponding flavones and flavonols. The mass spectrometric analysis showed that the enzyme was not the expected 7OMT, but a B-ring 4′OMT. OMTs with this specificity had not been described before, and 3′,4′- dimethylated flavonoids had not been found so far in C. roseus, but they are well-known from other plants. The identification of this enzyme activity raised the question whether methylation could be a part of the mechanisms channeling flavonoid biosynthesis. We investigated four purified recombinant 2-oxoglutarate-dependent flavonoid dioxygenases: flavanone 3{\ss}-hydroxylase, flavone synthase, flavonol synthase, and anthocyanidin synthase. 3′-O-Methyl-eriodictyol was a substrate for all four enzymes. The activities were only slightly lower than with the standard substrate naringenin, and in some cases much higher than with eriodictyol. Methylation in the A-ring, however, strongly reduced or abolished the activities with all four enzymes. The results suggested that B-ring 3′ methylation is no hindrance for flavonoid dioxygenases. These results characterized a new type of flavonoid O-methyltransferase, and also provided new insights into the catalytic capacities of key dioxygenases in flavonoid biosynthesis. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

CbiF contains two alphabeta domains forming a trough in which S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) binds. The location of AdoHcy and a number of conserved residues, helps define the precorrin binding site.

abstract = {Enthalpy-entropy compensations are a consequence of weak associations where the binding enthalpy is much lower than typical covalent bond strengths. The general form of an enthalpy-entropy curve is presented based upon theoretical considerations and justified on the basis of experimental data for associations in the gas phase and for monatomic sublimation. The intrinsic curvature of the enthalpy . entropy plot provides the basis for a description of co-operativity and binding phenomena in solution. In the case of cooperativity, we divide the mutual aiding of two interactions into two distinct parts, one of which is entropic in origin and related to the classical chelate enhancement of binding of Jencks; the other is an enthalpic benefit due to improved electrostatic bonding. Since the experimental Gibbs energy for all weak associations in solution is a consequence of competing solute-solvent, solvent-solvent and solute-solute interactions, the summation of these interactions can be usefully described by a vector analysis using the enthalpy-entropy curve. We illustrate the utility of this approach by presenting a qualitative description of the various contributions to binding in the following examples: () one-point associations in non-polar solvents, () entropy-driven association of two large discs involving the release of multiple solvent molecules and () enthalpy driven associations involving metal chelation by polyamines. By considering the curvature of the enthalpy-entropy plot for a given interaction, in combination with the possibility of making or breaking multiple interactions on one template, net enthalpies and entropies of association in solution can be explored in an approximate manner.},

This S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-linked enzyme transfers methyl groups to carboxyl-terminal isoprenylated cysteine residues of proteins, generating methyl esters. The enzyme also processes simple substrates such as N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine (L-AFC). Initial studies showed that a ping-pong Bi Bi mechanism could be eliminated. In a ping-pong Bi Bi mechanism plots of 1/v versus 1/[substrate A] at different fixed substrate B concentrations are expected to yield a family of parallel lines whose slopes equal Km/Vmax. In fact, converging curves were found, which suggested a sequential mechanism. Dead-end inhibitors were used in order to further investigate the kinetic mechanism. S-Farnesylthioacetic acid is shown to be a dead-end competitive inhibitor with respect to the prenylated substrate L-AFC. On the other hand, S-farnesylthioacetic acid proved to be uncompetitive with respect to AdoMet, suggesting an ordered mechanism with AdoMet binding first. Further evidence for this mechanism came from product inhibition studies using the methyl ester of L-AFC (L-AFCMe) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy). Since AdoMet binds first to the enzyme, one of the products (L-AFCMe or AdoHcy) should be a competitive inhibitor with respect to it. It could be shown that AdoHcy is a competitive inhibitor with respect to AdoMet, but L-AFCMe is a mixed-type inhibitor both with respect to AdoMet and to L-AFC. Therefore, AdoHcy combines with the same enzyme form as does AdoMet, and must be released from the enzyme last. Moreover, L-AFC and L-AFCMe must bind to different forms of the enzyme.},

Forty-four non-native S/Se-alkylated Met analogues were synthesized and applied to probing the substrate specificity of five diverse methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs). Human MAT II was among the most permissive of the MATs analyzed and enabled the chemoenzymatic synthesis of 29 non-native SAM analogues. As a proof of concept for the feasibility of natural product "alkylrandomization", a small set of differentially-alkylated indolocarbazole analogues was generated by using a coupled hMAT2-RebM system (RebM is the sugar C4'-O-methyltransferase that is involved in rebeccamycin biosynthesis). The ability to couple SAM synthesis and utilization in a single vessel circumvents issues associated with the rapid decomposition of SAM analogues and thereby opens the door for the further interrogation of a wide range of SAM utilizing enzymes.},

@article{Sleno2004,
abstract = {This tutorial presents the most common ion activation techniques employed in tandem mass spectrometry. In-source fragmentation and metastable ion decompositions, as well as the general theory of unimolecular dissociations of ions, are initially discussed. This is followed by tandem mass spectrometry, which implies that the activation of ions is distinct from the ionization step, and that the precursor and product ions are both characterized independently by their mass/charge ratios. In collision-induced dissociation (CID), activation of the selected ions occurs by collision(s) with neutral gas molecules in a collision cell. This experiment can be done at high (keV) collision energies, using tandem sector and time-of-flight instruments, or at low (eV range) energies, in tandem quadrupole and ion trapping instruments. It can be performed using either single or multiple collisions with a selected gas and each of these factors influences the distribution of internal energy that the activated ion will possess. While CID remains the most common ion activation technique employed in analytical laboratories today, several new methods have become increasingly useful for specific applications. More recent techniques are examined and their differences, advantages and disadvantages are described in comparison with CID. Collisional activation upon impact of precursor ions on solid surfaces, surface-induced dissociation (SID), is gaining importance as an alternative to gas targets and has been implemented in several different types of mass spectrometers. Furthermore, unique fragmentation mechanisms of multiply-charged species can be studied by electron-capture dissociation (ECD). The ECD technique has been recognized as an efficient means to study non-covalent interactions and to gain sequence information in proteomics applications. Trapping instruments, such as quadrupole ion traps and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance instruments, are particularly useful for the photoactivation of ions, specifically for fragmentation of precursor ions by infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD). IRMPD is a non-selective activation method and usually yields rich fragmentation spectra. Lastly, blackbody infrared radiative dissociation is presented with a focus on determining activation energies and other important parameters for the characterization of fragmentation pathways. The individual methods are presented so as to facilitate the understanding of each mechanism of activation and their particular advantages and representative applications.},

abstract = {S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) is a universal biological cofactor that is found in all branches of life where it plays a critical role in the transfer of methyl groups to various biomolecules, including DNA, proteins and small-molecule secondary metabolites. The methylation process thus has important implications in various disease processes and applications in industrial chemical processing. This methyl transfer is catalysed by SAM-dependent methyltransferases (MTases), which are by far the largest groups of SAM-dependent enzymes. A significant amount is now known regarding the structural biology and enzymology of these enzymes, and, consequently, there is now significant scope for the development of new MTases and SAM analogues for applications from biomolecular imaging to biocatalytic industrial processes. This review will focus on current efforts in the manipulation of class I and V SAM-dependent MTases and the use of synthetic SAM analogues, which together offer the best prospects for rational redesign towards biotechnological applications. Firstly, metabolic engineering of organisms incorporating small-molecule MTases is discussed; this can be applied in a variety of areas from the industrial bioprocessing of flavourants and antibiotics to frontier research in biofuel production and bioremediation. Secondly, the application of MTases in combination with SAM analogues is reviewed; this allows the tagging of proteins and oligonucleotides with moieties other than the methyl group. Such tagging allows the isolation of the tagged biomolecule and aids its visualisation by a range of analytical methods. The review then summarises the potential advantages of MTase-mediated chemistry and offers some future perspectives on downstream applications.},

abstract = {Inducible expression systems in which T7 RNA polymerase transcribes coding sequences cloned under control of a T7lac promoter efficiently produce a wide variety of proteins in Escherichia coli. Investigation of factors that affect stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic, unintended induction of expression in complex media, previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations. These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain plasmid and remain fully viable for weeks in the refrigerator, making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by conventional IPTG induction. Auto-inducing media have been developed for labeling proteins with selenomethionine, 15N or 13C, and for production of target proteins by arabinose induction of T7 RNA polymerase from the pBAD promoter in BL21-AI. Selenomethionine labeling was equally efficient in the commonly used methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) (found to be metE) or the prototroph BL21(DE3).},

A generated variant containing a Ser residue at this position, however, resulted in poor ability to express soluble and enzymatically active protein. Characterization of NovO revealed a type I methyltransferase that performs its action as a dimer in solution. Functional elements include the conserved S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) binding site (consensus: E/DXXXGXG) as DLCCGSG (residues 45-51).

abstract = {Metabolic conversion of inorganic arsenic into methylated products is a multistep process that yields mono-, di-, and trimethylated arsenicals. In recent years, it has become apparent that formation of methylated metabolites of inorganic arsenic is not necessarily a detoxification process. Intermediates and products formed in this pathway may be more reactive and toxic than inorganic arsenic. Like all metabolic pathways, understanding the pathway for arsenic methylation involves identification of each individual step in the process and the characterization of the molecules which participate in each step. Among several arsenic methyltransferases that have been identified, arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase is the one best characterized at the genetic and functional levels. This review focuses on phylogenetic relationships in the deuterostomal lineage for this enzyme and on the relation between genotype for arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase and phenotype for conversion of inorganic arsenic to methylated metabolites. Two conceptual models for function of arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase which posit different roles for cellular reductants in the conversion of inorganic arsenic to methylated metabolites are compared. Although each model accurately represents some aspects of enzyme’s role in the pathway for arsenic methylation, neither model is a fully satisfactory representation of all the steps in this metabolic pathway. Additional information on the structure and function of the enzyme will be needed to develop a more comprehensive model for this pathway.},

Here we report the chemoenzymatic synthesis of a series of SAM analogs using wild-type (wt) and point mutants of two recently identified halogenases, SalL and FDAS. Molecular modelling studies are used to guide the rational design of mutants, and the enzymatic conversion of L-Met and other analogs into SAM analogs is demonstrated. We also apply this in situ enzymatic synthesis to the modification of a small peptide substrate by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). This technique offers an attractive alternative to chemical synthesis and can be applied in situ to overcome stability and activity issues.},

abstract = {Human procathepsin S and cathepsin S were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Following solubilization of the inclusion body proteins, fractional factorial protein folding screens were used to identify folding conditions for procathepsin S and cathepsin S. A primary folding screen, including eight factors each at two levels, identified pH and arginine as the main factors affecting procathepsin S folding. In a second simple screen, the yields were further improved. The in vitro folding of mature cathepsin S has never been reported previously. In this study we used a series of fractional factorial screens to identify conditions that enabled the active enzyme to be generated without the prodomain although the yields were much lower than achieved with procathepsin S. Our data show the power of fractional factorial screens to rapidly identify folding conditions even for a protein that does not easily fold into its active conformation.},

abstract = {Worldwide in the last two decades, in Latin America in the last decade, and Mexico in particular cerebral endoscopy as part of the minimally invasive neurological surgery, has constituted a significant advance for the treatment of neurological diseases such as congenital or acquired hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation, neurocysticercosis, stroke, ventricular and paraventricular tumors and cysts, arachnoidal cyst and hydrocephalus secondary to shunt malfunction. The lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, the cerebral aqueduct, the fourth ventricle, and the subarachnoid basal cisterns are among the most non-accessible regions of the central nervous system. Due to light-rand fiber optic-systems in combination with the experiences of nine consecutive year's and more than 600 endoscopies, most of them flexible neuroendoscopies, we present the neuroendoscopic approach with flexible cerebral endoscope to the anatomy and its normal variants of the whole ventricle system and the subarachnoid basal cisterns including the subarachnoid space of the cervical spine. We also describe their site related structures including veins, arteries, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, choroidal plexus and their normal anatomic variants.},

abstract = {Methyltransferases possess a homologous domain that requires both a divalent metal cation and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to catalyze its reactions. The kinetics of several methyltransferases has been well characterized; however, the details regarding their structural mechanisms have remained unclear to date. Using catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) as a model, we perform discrete molecular dynamics and computational docking simulations to elucidate the initial stages of cofactor binding. We find that COMT binds SAM via an induced-fit mechanism, where SAM adopts a different docking pose in the absence of metal and substrate in comparison to the holoenzyme. Flexible modeling of the active site side-chains is essential for observing the lowest energy state in the apoenzyme; rigid docking tools are unable to recapitulate the pose unless the appropriate side-chain conformations are given a priori. From our docking results, we hypothesize that the metal reorients SAM in a conformation suitable for donating its methyl substituent to the recipient ligand. The proposed mechanism enables a general understanding of how divalent metal cations contribute to methyltransferase function.},

abstract = {Recombinant proteins are often expressed in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies in bacteria. To facilitate refolding of recombinant proteins obtained from inclusion bodies, 0.1 to 1 M arginine is customarily included in solvents used for refolding the proteins by dialysis or dilution. In addition, arginine at higher concentrations, e.g., 0.5-2 M, can be used to extract active, folded proteins from insoluble pellets obtained after lysing Escherichia coli cells. Moreover, arginine increases the yield of proteins secreted to the periplasm, enhances elution of antibodies from Protein-A columns, and stabilizes proteins during storage. All these arginine effects are apparently due to suppression of protein aggregation. Little is known, however, about the mechanism. Various effects of solvent additives on proteins have been attributed to their preferential interaction with the protein, effects on surface tension, or effects on amino acid solubility. The suppression of protein aggregation by arginine cannot be readily explained by either surface tension effects or preferential interactions. In this review we show that interactions between the guanidinium group of arginine and tryptophan side chains may be responsible for suppression of protein aggregation by arginine.},

The PCR-amplified CA4H open reading frame was inserted into pYeDP60 under the transcriptional control of a galactose-inducible artificial promoter. Engineered S. cerevisiae strains producing human P450 reductase or normal or overproduced amounts of yeast P450 reductase were transformed to express recombinant CA4H. When grown on galactose, yeast cells produced CA4H holoprotein bound to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane as judged from the reduced iron/carbon monoxide difference spectrum centered at 452 nm and from typical cinnamate 4-hydroxylase activity upon coupling with the different P450 reductases and NADPH. Some CA4H protein was found also addressed to the yeast mitochondria but as a low-activity form. The spectral and kinetic characterizations of the yeast-produced CA4H in different redox protein environments are presented using both assays on yeast microsomal fractions and bioconversions on living cells. Results indicate that the microsomal system constituted by the overexpressed yeast P450 reductase and CA4H is characterized by a 1:1 coupling between NADPH oxidation and cinnamate hydroxylation and by one of the highest turnover numbers reported for an NADPH-dependent P450 reaction. Based on spectral perturbation and inhibition studies, coumarate appeared to have no detectable affinity for the enzyme. A possible geometry of the substrate recognition pocket is discussed in the light of these data.},

This contribution describes the organization and some aspects of the use of the flexible and human/machine-readable dictionary of prior chemical knowledge used by the maximum-likelihood macromolecular-refinement program REFMAC5. The dictionary stores information about monomers which represent the constitutive building blocks of biological macromolecules (amino acids, nucleic acids and saccharides) and about numerous organic/inorganic compounds commonly found in macromolecular crystallography. It also describes the modifications the building blocks undergo as a result of chemical reactions and the links required for polymer formation. More than 2000 monomer entries, 100 modification entries and 200 link entries are currently available. Algorithms and tools for updating and adding new entries to the dictionary have also been developed and are presented here. In many cases, the REFMAC5 dictionary allows entirely automatic generation of restraints within REFMAC5 refinement runs.},

abstract = {A liquid chromatography-particle-beam mass spectrometer (LC-PB/MS) with interchangeable electron-impact (EI) and glow-discharge (GD) ion sources was evaluated for future application in analysis of botanical extracts. In this work a green tea tincture was characterized for a series of catechin components (catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) and caffeine. Special emphasis was given to EGCG and caffeine, because they are important in determining the possible health effects of the green tea. The effects of instrument operating conditions were evaluated for the EI and GD ionization sources to determine their effect on analyte intensities and fragmentation patterns. These studies furnished information about the effects of these conditions in determining possible ionization pathways in the two ion sources. The mass spectra of these compounds obtained with the GD ion source are EI-like in appearance, with clearly identified molecular ions and fragmentation patterns that are easily rationalized. The absolute limits of detection for EGCG and caffeine were, respectively, 11 ng and 0.77 ng for the EI source and 3.2 ng and 0.61 ng for the GD source. The PB/EIMS and PB/GDMS combinations can be operated in a flow-injection mode, wherein the analyte is injected directly into the mobile phase, or coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enabling LC-MS analysis of complex mixtures. A reversed-phase chromatographic separation of the green tea tincture was performed on a commercial C18 column using a gradient of water (containing 0.1{\%} TFA) and ACN. Quantification of EGCG and caffeine was performed by the standard addition method. The amounts of EGCG and caffeine in the tested green tea tincture were each approximately 14 mg mL-1.},

abstract = {Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT, EC 2.1.1.6) is important in the central nervous system because it metabolizes catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. The enzyme catalyses the transfer of the methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to one hydroxyl group of catechols. COMT also inactivates catechol-type compounds such as L-DOPA. With selective inhibitors of COMT in combination with L-DOPA, a new principle has been realized in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. Here we solve the atomic structure of COMT to 2.0 A resolution, which provides new insights into the mechanism of the methyl transfer reaction. The co-enzyme-binding domain is strikingly similar to that of an AdoMet-dependent DNA methylase, indicating that all AdoMet methylases may have a common structure.},

abstract = {One of the main stumbling blocks encountered when attempting to express foreign proteins in Escherichia coli is the occurrence of amorphous aggregates of misfolded proteins, called inclusion bodies (IB). Developing efficient protein native structure recovery procedures based on IB refolding is therefore an important challenge. Unfortunately, there is no "universal" refolding buffer: Experience shows that refolding buffer composition varies from one protein to another. In addition, the methods developed so far for finding a suitable refolding buffer suffer from a number of weaknesses. These include the small number of refolding formulations, which often leads to negative results, solubility assays incompatible with high-throughput, and experiment formatting not suitable for automation. To overcome these problems, it was proposed in the present study to address some of these limitations. This resulted in the first completely automated IB refolding screening procedure to be developed using a 96-well format. The 96 refolding buffers were obtained using a fractional factorial approach. The screening procedure is potentially applicable to any nonmembrane protein, and was validated with 24 proteins in the framework of two Structural Genomics projects. The tests used for this purpose included the use of quality control methods such as circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and crystallogenesis. Out of the 24 proteins, 17 remained soluble in at least one of the 96 refolding buffers, 15 passed large-scale purification tests, and five gave crystals.},

abstract = {Protein methyltransferases (PMTs) catalyze arginine and lysine methylation of diverse histone and nonhistone targets. These posttranslational modifications play essential roles in regulating multiple cellular events in an epigenetic manner. In the recent process of defining PMT targets, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analogues have emerged as powerful small molecule probes to label and profile PMT targets. To examine efficiently the reactivity of PMTs and their variants on SAM analogues, we transformed a fluorogenic PMT assay into a ready high throughput screening (HTS) format. The reformulated fluorogenic assay is featured by its uncoupled but more robust character with the first step of accumulation of the commonly-shared reaction byproduct S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), followed by SAH-hydrolase-mediated fluorogenic quantification. The HTS readiness and robustness of the assay were demonstrated by its excellent Z' values of 0.83-0.95 for the so-far-examined 8 human PMTs with SAM as a cofactor (PRMT1, PRMT3, CARM1, SUV39H2, SET7/9, SET8, G9a and GLP1). The fluorogenic assay was further implemented to screen the PMTs against five SAM analogues (allyl-SAM, propargyl-SAM, (E)-pent-2-en-4-ynyl-SAM (EnYn-SAM), (E)-hex-2-en-5-ynyl-SAM (Hey-SAM) and 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl-SAM (Pob-SAM)). Among the examined 8 × 5 pairs of PMTs and SAM analogues, native SUV39H2, G9a and GLP1 showed promiscuous activity on allyl-SAM. In contrast, the bulky SAM analogues, such as EnYn-SAM, Hey-SAM and Pob-SAM, are inert toward the panel of human PMTs. These findings therefore provide the useful structure-activity guidance to further evolve PMTs and SAM analogues for substrate labeling. The current assay format is ready to screen methyltransferase variants on structurally-diverse SAM analogues.},

abstract = {Human protein methyltransferases (PMTs) play essential roles through methylating histone and nonhistone targets. It is very challenging to profile global methylation (or methylome) in the context of relevant cellular settings. Unlike other posttranslational modifications such as lysine acetylation or Ser/Thr/Tyr/His phosphorylation, methylation of lysine or arginine does not significantly alter its physical properties (e.g. charge and size) and therefore may not be probed readily by conventional biological tools such antibodies. It is also not trivial to assign unambiguously dynamic methylation events to specific PMTs given their potential redundancy. This review focuses on the decade-long progress in developing complementary chemical tools to elucidate targets of designated PMTs. One of such efforts was to develop the Bioorthogonal Profiling of Protein Methylation (BPPM) technology in vitro and inside living cells. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Methionine adenosyltransferases (MATs) catalyze the formation of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) inside living cells. Recently, S-alkyl analogues of SAM have been documented as cofactor surrogates to label novel targets of methyltransferases. However, these chemically synthesized SAM analogues are not suitable for cell-based studies because of their poor membrane permeability. This issue was recently addressed under a cellular setting through a chemoenzymatic strategy to process membrane-permeable S-alkyl analogues of methionine (SAAMs) into the SAM analogues with engineered MATs. Here we describe a general sensitive activity assay for engineered MATs by converting the reaction products into S-alkylthioadenosines, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) quantification. With this assay, 40 human MAT mutants were evaluated against 7 SAAMs as potential substrates. The structure-activity relationship revealed that, besides better engaged SAAM binding by the MAT mutants (lower Km value in contrast to native MATs), the gained activity toward the bulky SAAMs stems from their ability to maintain the desired linear SN2 transition state (reflected by higher kcat value). Here the I117A mutant of human MATI was identified as the most active variant for biochemical production of SAM analogues from diverse SAAMs. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Elucidating physiological and pathogenic functions of protein methyltransferases (PMTs) relies on knowing their substrate profiles. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is the sole methyl-donor cofactor of PMTs. Recently, SAM analogues have emerged as novel small-molecule tools to efficiently label PMT substrates. Here we reported the development of a clickable SAM analogue cofactor, 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl SAM, and its implementation to label substrates of human protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). In the system, the SAM analogue cofactor, coupled with matched PRMT1 mutants rather than native PRMT1, was shown to label PRMT1 substrates. The transferable 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl moiety of the SAM analogue further allowed corresponding modified substrates to be characterized through a subsequent click chemical ligation with an azido-based probe. The SAM analogue, in combination with a rational protein-engineering approach, thus shows potential to label and identify PMT targets in the context of a complex cellular mixture.},

abstract = {A recurring obstacle for structural genomics is the expression of insoluble, aggregated proteins. In these cases, the use of alternative salvage strategies, like in vitro refolding, is hindered by the lack of a universal refolding method. To overcome this obstacle, fractional factorial screens have been introduced as a systematic and rapid method to identify refolding conditions. However, methodical analyses of the effectiveness of refolding reagents on large sets of proteins remain limited. In this study, we address this void by designing a fractional factorial screen to rapidly explore the effect of 14 different reagents on the refolding of 33 structurally and functionally diverse proteins. The refolding data was analyzed using statistical methods to determine the effect of each refolding additive. The screen has been miniaturized for automation resulting in reduced protein requirements and increased throughput. Our results show that the choice of pH and reducing agent had the largest impact on protein refolding. Bis-mercaptoacetamide cyclohexane (BMC) and tris (2-carboxyethylphosphine) (TCEP) were superior reductants when compared to others in the screen. BMC was particularly effective in refolding disulfide-containing proteins, while TCEP was better for nondisulfide-containing proteins. From the screen, we successfully identified a positive synergistic interaction between nondetergent sulfobetaine 201 (NDSB 201) and BMC on Cdc25A refolding. The soluble protein resulting from this interaction crystallized and yielded a 2.2 Angstroms structure. Our method, which combines a fractional factorial screen with statistical analysis of the data, provides a powerful approach for the identification of optimal refolding reagents in a general refolding screen.},

abstract = {Methylation is one of the most common chemical modifications of biologically active molecules and it occurs in all life forms. Its functional role is very diverse and involves many essential cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcriptional control, biosynthesis, and metabolism. Here, we provide further insight into the enzymatic methylation in S. cerevisiae by conducting a comprehensive structural and functional survey of all the methyltransferases encoded in its genome. Using distant homology detection and fold recognition, we found that the S. cerevisiae methyltransferome comprises 86 MTases (53 well-known and 33 putative with unknown substrate specificity). Structural classification of their catalytic domains shows that these enzymes may adopt nine different folds, the most common being the Rossmann-like. We also analyzed the domain architecture of these proteins and identified several new domain contexts. Interestingly, we found that the majority of MTase genes are periodically expressed during yeast metabolic cycle. This finding, together with calculated isoelectric point, fold assignment and cellular localization, was used to develop a novel approach for predicting substrate specificity. Using this approach, we predicted the general substrates for 24 of 33 putative MTases and confirmed these predictions experimentally in both cases tested. Finally, we show that, in S. cerevisiae, methylation is carried out by 34 RNA MTases, 32 protein MTases, eight small molecule MTases, three lipid MTases, and nine MTases with still unknown substrate specificity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mass spectrometry has become the analytical method of choice in metabolomics research. The identification of unknown compounds is the main bottleneck. In addition to the precursor mass, tandem MS spectra carry informative fragment peaks, but the coverage of spectral libraries of measured reference compounds are far from covering the complete chemical space. Compound libraries such as PubChem or KEGG describe a larger number of compounds, which can be used to compare their in silico fragmentation with spectra of unknown metabolites.RESULTS: We created the MetFrag suite to obtain a candidate list from compound libraries based on the precursor mass, subsequently ranked by the agreement between measured and in silico fragments. In the evaluation MetFrag was able to rank most of the correct compounds within the top 3 candidates returned by an exact mass query in KEGG. Compared to a previously published study, MetFrag obtained better results than the commercial MassFrontier software. Especially for large compound libraries, the candidates with a good score show a high structural similarity or just different stereochemistry, a subsequent clustering based on chemical distances reduces this redundancy. The in silico fragmentation requires less than a second to process a molecule, and MetFrag performs a search in KEGG or PubChem on average within 30 to 300 seconds, respectively, on an average desktop PC.CONCLUSIONS: We presented a method that is able to identify small molecules from tandem MS measurements, even without spectral reference data or a large set of fragmentation rules. With today's massive general purpose compound libraries we obtain dozens of very similar candidates, which still allows a confident estimate of the correct compound class. Our tool MetFrag improves the identification of unknown substances from tandem MS spectra and delivers better results than comparable commercial software. MetFrag is available through a web application, web services and as java library. The web frontend allows the end-user to analyse single spectra and browse the results, whereas the web service and console application are aimed to perform batch searches and evaluation},

abstract = {LC/MS/MS is becoming a very important tool for the on-line identification of natural products in crude plant extracts. For an efficient use of this technique in the dereplication of natural products, a careful study of the parameters used to generate informative MS/MS spectra is needed. In this paper the CID MS/MS spectra of ubiquitous flavonoids and related plant constituents have been systematically studied using hybrid quadrupole time of flight (Q-TOF) and ion trap (IT) mass analysers under various CID energy conditions. The results demonstrate that, if for hydroxylated flavonoids the CID MS/MS spectra generated on both instruments are similar, for partially methoxylated derivatives, important differences are observed hampering the creation of MS/MS databases exchangeable between instruments. Generally, fragments issued from C-ring cleavage, corresponding to those classically reported, were recorded but they were more easily observed on a Q-TOF instrument while losses of small molecules were favoured in IT-MS. MS/MS spectra recorded in the positive ion mode were more informative than those obtained from negative ions. For the assignment of flavonoids product ion spectra, on-line accurate mass measurement of all MS/MS fragments was obtained on the Q-TOF, while the multiple stage MSn capability of the ion trap was used to prove fragmentation pathways.},

Through gene inactivation and complementation, asm10 was proved to be responsible for the N-methylation of ansamitocins. Asm10 is a 33.0 kDa monomer, as determined by gel filtration. By using N-desmethyl-ansamitocin P-3 as substrate, the optimal temperature and pH for Asm10 catalysis were determined to be 32 °C and 10.0, respectively. Asm10 also showed broad substrate flexibility toward other N-desmethyl-ansamycins and synthetic indolin-2-ones. Through site-directed mutagenesis, Asp154 and Leu155 of Asm10 were confirmed to be essential for its catalysis, possibly through the binding of SAM. The characterization of this unique N-methyltransferase has enriched the toolbox for engineering N-methylated derivatives from both natural and synthetic compounds; this will allow known potential drugs to be modified.},

abstract = {Acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation of the amino-terminal tails of histones are thought to be involved in the regulation of chromatin structure and function. With just one exception, the enzymes identified in the methylation of specific lysine residues on histones (histone methyltransferases) belong to the SET family. The high-resolution crystal structure of a ternary complex of human SET7/9 with a histone peptide and cofactor reveals that the peptide substrate and cofactor bind on opposite surfaces of the enzyme. The target lysine accesses the active site of the enzyme and the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) cofactor by inserting its side chain into a narrow channel that runs through the enzyme, connecting the two surfaces. Here we show from the structure and from solution studies that SET7/9, unlike most other SET proteins, is exclusively a mono-methylase. The structure indicates the molecular basis of the specificity of the enzyme for the histone target, and allows us to propose a model for the methylation reaction that accounts for the role of many of the residues that are invariant across the SET family.},

abstract = {Biologically active proteins are useful for studying the biological functions of genes and for the development of therapeutic drugs and biomaterials in a biotechnology industry. Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. As inclusion bodies contain relatively pure and intact proteins, protein refolding is an important process to obtain active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, conventional refolding methods, such as dialysis and dilution, are time consuming and, often, recovered yields of active proteins are low, and a trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. Recently, several approaches have been reported to refold these aggregated proteins into an active form. The strategies largely aim at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure. This review focuses on protein refolding techniques using chemical additives and laminar flow in microfluidic chips for the efficient recovery of active proteins from inclusion bodies.},

Among them, one gene (viz., saomt5) was cloned into the pET-15b expression vector by polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers. Biochemical characterization with the recombinant protein showed that SaOMT5 was S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent Omethyltransferase. Several compounds were tested as substrates of SaOMT5. As a result, SaOMT5 catalyzed Omethylation of flavonoids such as 6,7-dihydroxyflavone, 2',3'-dihydroxyflavone, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone, quercetin, and 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, and phenolic compounds such as caffeic acid and caffeoyl Co-A. These reaction products were analyzed by TLC, HPLC, LC/MS, and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, SaOMT5 could convert phenolic compounds containing ortho-dihydroxy groups into Omethylated compounds, and 6,7-dihydroxyflavone was known to be the best substrate. SaOMT5 converted 6,7- dihydroxyflavone into 6-hydroxy-7-methoxyflavone and 7-hydroxy-6-methoxyflavone, and caffeic acid into ferulic acid and isoferulic acid, respectively. Moreover, SaOMT5 turned out to be a Mg2+-dependent OMT, and the effect of Mg2+ ion on its activity was five times greater than those of Ca2+, Fe2+, and Cu2+ ions, EDTA, and metal-free medium.},

Inorganic As can be transformed by microbial methylation, which constitutes an important part of the As biogeochemical cycle. In this study, we investigated As biotransformation by Pseudomonas alcaligenes NBRC14159. P. alcaligenes was able to methylate arsenite [As(III)] rapidly to dimethylarsenate and small amounts of trimethylarsenic oxide. An arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase, PaArsM, was identified and functionally characterized. PaArsM shares low similarities with other reported ArsM enzymes (less than 55{\%}). When P. alcaligenes arsM gene (PaarsM) was disrupted, the mutant lost As methylation ability and became more sensitive to As(III). PaarsM was expressed in the absence of As(III) and the expression was further enhanced by As(III) exposure. Heterologous expression of PaarsM in an As-hypersensitive strain of Escherichia coli conferred As(III) resistance. Purified PaArsM protein methylated As(III) to dimethylarsenate as the main product in the medium and also produced dimethylarsine and trimethylarsine gases. We propose that PaArsM plays a role in As methylation and detoxification of As(III) and could be exploited in bioremediation of As-contaminated environments.},

abstract = {Scopolamine is a pharmaceutically important tropane alkaloid extensively used as an anticholinergic agent. Here, we report the simultaneous introduction and overexpression of genes encoding the rate-limiting upstream enzyme putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) and the downstream enzyme hyoscyamine 6 beta-hydroxylase (H6H) of scopolamine biosynthesis in transgenic henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) hairy root cultures. Transgenic hairy root lines expressing both pmt and h6h produced significantly higher (P < 0.05) levels of scopolamine compared with the wild-type and transgenic lines harboring a single gene (pmt or h6h). The best line (T(3)) produced 411 mg/liter scopolamine, which was over nine times more than that in the wild type (43 mg/liter) and more than twice the amount in the highest scopolamine-producing h6h single-gene transgenic line H(11) (184 mg/liter). To our knowledge, this is the highest scopolamine content achieved through genetic engineering of a plant. We conclude that transgenic plants harboring both pmt and h6h possessed an increased flux in the tropane alkaloid biosynthetic pathway that enhanced scopolamine yield, which was more efficient than plants harboring only one of the two genes. It seems that the pulling force of the downstream enzyme (the faucet enzyme) H6H plays a more important role in stimulating scopolamine accumulation in H. niger whereas the functioning of the upstream enzyme PMT is increased proportionally. This study provides an effective approach for large-scale commercial production of scopolamine by using hairy root culture systems as bioreactors.},

Although this modification usually occurs on protein substrates, recent studies have shown that it also takes place on ribosomally synthesized natural products. Here we report an investigation of the bacterial $\alpha$-N-methyltransferase CypM involved in the biosynthesis of the peptide antibiotic cypemycin. We demonstrate that CypM has low substrate selectivity and methylates a variety of oligopeptides, cyclic peptides such as nisin and haloduracin, and the $\epsilon$-amino group of lysine. Hence it may have potential for enzyme engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis. Bayesian phylogenetic inference of bacterial $\alpha$-N-methyltransferases suggests that they have not evolved as a specific group based on the chemical transformations they catalyze, but that they have been acquired from various other methyltransferase classes during evolution.},

The recombinant TaOMT2 protein was purified to near homogeneity and tested for its substrate preference against a number of phenolic compounds.

The sequential order of tricetin methylation by TaOMT2 is envisaged to proceed via its 3???-mono- ??? 3???,5???-di- ??? 3???,4???,5???-trimethyl ether derivatives.

abstract = {The health benefits of flavonoids for humans are increasingly attracting attention. Because the extraction of high-purity flavonoids from plants presents a major obstacle, interest has emerged in biosynthesizing them using microbial hosts. Eriodictyol is a flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. Its efficient synthesis has been hampered by two factors: the poor expression of cytochrome P450 and the low intracellular malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) concentration in Escherichia coli. To address these issues, a truncated plant P450 flavonoid, flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (tF3'H), was functionally expressed as a fusion protein with a truncated P450 reductase (tCPR) in E. coli. This allowed the engineered E. coli to produce eriodictyol from l-tyrosine by simultaneously coexpressing the fusion protein with tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI). In addition, metabolic engineering was employed to enhance the availability of malonyl-CoA so as to achieve a new metabolic balance and rebalance the relative expression of genes to enhance eriodictyol accumulation. This approach made the production of eriodictyol 203{\%} higher than that in the control strain. By using these strategies, the production of eriodictyol from l-tyrosine reached 107 mg/liter. The present work offers an approach to the efficient synthesis of other hydroxylated flavonoids from l-tyrosine or even glucose in E. coli.},

Structurally guided site-directed mutagenesis of active site residues was performed with the goal of altering the kinetic preferences for physiological substrates. The kinetic parameters of the COMT mutants versus wild-type enzyme are presented, and coupled with the high-resolution crystal structures, they will serve as a starting point for the in vivo manipulation of lignin monomers in transgenic plants. Ultimately, this structurally based approach to metabolic engineering will allow the further alteration of the lignin biosynthetic pathway in agronomically important plants.

Two unusual extensions are presented: Multiscale, which adds the ability to visualize large-scale molecular assemblies such as viral coats, and Collaboratory, which allows researchers to share a Chimera session interactively despite being at separate locales. Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions.

Flavones (Apigenin, etc):
- peaks at earlier retention times (C-ring opened?? / hydrolyis)
--> mass doesn't fit to opened c-ring
Kaempferol (F_15):
- eigenartiges chromatogramm
i-FA and FA:
- doubly methylated product (dimethylcaffeic acid) --> peak @ 12.95min --> spectrum looks different if wt or variant is used ???

abstract = {Macromolecular X-ray crystallography is routinely applied to understand biological processes at a molecular level. However, significant time and effort are still required to solve and complete many of these structures because of the need for manual interpretation of complex numerical data using many software packages and the repeated use of interactive three-dimensional graphics. PHENIX has been developed to provide a comprehensive system for macromolecular crystallographic structure solution with an emphasis on the automation of all procedures. This has relied on the development of algorithms that minimize or eliminate subjective input, the development of algorithms that automate procedures that are traditionally performed by hand and, finally, the development of a framework that allows a tight integration between the algorithms.},

abstract = {MolProbity is a structure-validation web service that provides broad-spectrum solidly based evaluation of model quality at both the global and local levels for both proteins and nucleic acids. It relies heavily on the power and sensitivity provided by optimized hydrogen placement and all-atom contact analysis, complemented by updated versions of covalent-geometry and torsion-angle criteria. Some of the local corrections can be performed automatically in MolProbity and all of the diagnostics are presented in chart and graphical forms that help guide manual rebuilding. X-ray crystallography provides a wealth of biologically important molecular data in the form of atomic three-dimensional structures of proteins, nucleic acids and increasingly large complexes in multiple forms and states. Advances in automation, in everything from crystallization to data collection to phasing to model building to refinement, have made solving a structure using crystallography easier than ever. However, despite these improvements, local errors that can affect biological interpretation are widespread at low resolution and even high-resolution structures nearly all contain at least a few local errors such as Ramachandran outliers, flipped branched protein side chains and incorrect sugar puckers. It is critical both for the crystallographer and for the end user that there are easy and reliable methods to diagnose and correct these sorts of errors in structures. MolProbity is the authors' contribution to helping solve this problem and this article reviews its general capabilities, reports on recent enhancements and usage, and presents evidence that the resulting improvements are now beneficially affecting the global database.},

abstract = {A simple spectrophotometric microplate assay that allows quantification of the interaction between phospholipids and metal ions or other small cationic compounds has been developed. The assay is based on the competition of the phospholipids for the Fe(3+) ion in the purple-colored Fe(III)-$\gamma$-resorcylate complex and for other cations. To compare the binding affinities of several cation-phospholipid interactions, K0.5 values were derived from binding curves constructed by determination of the absorbance of the Fe(III)-$\gamma$-resorcylate at 490 nm as a function of the cation concentration. The assay was used to analyze the binding of lanthanide ions, calcium ions, and amines (hydrochlorides of ethanolamine, spermidine, and hexyltrimethylammonium chloride) to small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) and mixed micelles containing anionic lipids such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl-p-nitrophenol. The method was evaluated by fluorescence measurements with Eu(3+) ions as tracer. Lanthanide ions such as La(3+) and Ce(3+) ions showed K0.5 values smaller by one to two orders of magnitude compared with Ca(2+) ions. In the presence of increasing amounts of detergents such as Triton X-100, the method also reflected transitions from SUVs to micelles. The binding capacity for metal ions was higher for phospholipid-containing micelles than for the corresponding SUVs.},

Furthermore, tools are provided for model validation as well as interfaces to external programs for refinement, validation and graphics. The software is designed to be easy to learn for novice users, which is achieved by ensuring that tools for common tasks are 'discoverable' through familiar user-interface elements (menus and toolbars) or by intuitive behaviour (mouse controls). Recent developments have focused on providing tools for expert users, with customisable key bindings, extensions and an extensive scripting interface. The software is under rapid development, but has already achieved very widespread use within the crystallographic community. The current state of the software is presented, with a description of the facilities available and of some of the underlying methods employed.},

abstract = {Current cloning technologies based on site-specific recombination are efficient, simple to use, and flexible, but have the drawback of leaving recombination site sequences in the final construct, adding an extra 8 to 13 amino acids to the expressed protein. We have devised a simple and rapid subcloning strategy to transfer any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence. With proper design of the cleavage sites, two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site. Based on this property, a cloning strategy called 'Golden Gate' cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation. This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct, thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation.},

After scaling, the intensities can be analysed to set the real resolution of the data set, to detect bad regions (e.g. bad images), to analyse radiation damage and to assess the overall quality of the data set. The significance of any anomalous signal may be assessed by probability and correlation analysis. The algorithms used by the CCP4 scaling program SCALA are described. A requirement for the scaling and merging of intensities is knowledge of the Laue group and point-group symmetries: the possible symmetry of the diffraction pattern may be determined from scores such as correlation coefficients between observations which might be symmetry-related. These scoring functions are implemented in a new program POINTLESS.},

Modern ITC instruments make it possible to measure heat rates as small as 0.1 microcal/sec, allowing for the precise determination of reaction rates in the range of 10(-12) mol/sec. Values for K(m) and k(cat), in the ranges of 10(-2) - 10(3) microM and 0.05 - 500 sec(-1), respectively, can be determined by ITC.

abstract = {Quantitative study of protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions in solution requires accurate determination of protein concentration. Often, for proteins available only in "molecular biological" amounts, it is difficult or impossible to make an accurate experimental measurement of the molar extinction coefficient of the protein. Yet without a reliable value of this parameter, one cannot determine protein concentrations by the usual uv spectroscopic means. Fortunately, knowledge of amino acid residue sequence and promoter molecular weight (and thus also of amino acid composition) is generally available through the DNA sequence, which is usually accurately known for most such proteins. In this paper we present a method for calculating accurate (to +/- 5\% in most cases) molar extinction coefficients for proteins at 280 nm, simply from knowledge of the amino acid composition. The method is calibrated against 18 "normal" globular proteins whose molar extinction coefficients are accurately known, and the assumptions underlying the method, as well as its limitations, are discussed.},

@article{Ibdah2003,
abstract = {Upon irradiation with elevated light intensities, the ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) accumulates a complex pattern of methylated and glycosylated flavonol conjugates in the upper epidermal layer. Identification of a flavonol methylating activity, partial purification of the enzyme, and sequencing of the corresponding peptide fragments revealed a novel S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that was specific for flavonoids and caffeoyl-CoA. Cloning and functional expression of the corresponding cDNA verified that the new methyltransferase is a multifunctional 26.6-kDa Mg(2+)-dependent enzyme, which shows a significant sequence similarity to the cluster of caffeoyl coenzyme A-methylating enzymes. Functional analysis of highly homologous members from chickweed (Stellaria longipes), Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) demonstrated that the enzymes from the ice plant, chickweed, and A. thaliana possess a broader substrate specificity toward o-hydroquinone-like structures than previously anticipated for Mg(2+)-dependent O-methyltransferases, and are distinctly different from the tobacco enzyme. Besides caffeoyl-CoA and flavonols, a high specificity was also observed for caffeoylglucose, a compound never before reported to be methylated by any plant O-methyltransferase. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence and differences in acceptor specificities among both animal and plant O-methyltransferases, we propose that the enzymes from the Centrospermae, along with the predicted gene product from A. thaliana, form a novel subclass within the caffeoyl coenzyme A-dependent O-methyltransferases, with potential divergent functions not restricted to lignin monomer biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Plant S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent class I natural product O-methyltransferases (OMTs), related to animal catechol OMTs, are dependent on bivalent cations and strictly specific for the meta position of aromatic vicinal dihydroxy groups. While the primary activity of these class I enzymes is methylation of caffeoyl coenzyme A OMTs, a distinct subset is able to methylate a wider range of substrates, characterized by the promiscuous phenylpropanoid and flavonoid OMT. The observed broad substrate specificity resides in two regions: the N-terminus and a variable insertion loop near the C-terminus, which displays the lowest degree of sequence conservation between the two subfamilies. Structural and biochemical data, based on site-directed mutagenesis and domain exchange between the two enzyme types, present evidence that only small topological changes among otherwise highly conserved 3-D structures are sufficient to differentiate between an enzymatic generalist and an enzymatic specialist in plant natural product methylation. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Molecular replacement (MR) generally becomes more difficult as the number of components in the asymmetric unit requiring separate MR models (i.e. the dimensionality of the search) increases. When the proportion of the total scattering contributed by each search component is small, the signal in the search for each component in isolation is weak or non-existent. Maximum-likelihood MR functions enable complex asymmetric units to be built up from individual components with a ;tree search with pruning' approach. This method, as implemented in the automated search procedure of the program Phaser, has been very successful in solving many previously intractable MR problems. However, there are a number of cases in which the automated search procedure of Phaser is suboptimal or encounters difficulties. These include cases where there are a large number of copies of the same component in the asymmetric unit or where the components of the asymmetric unit have greatly varying B factors. Two case studies are presented to illustrate how Phaser can be used to best advantage in the standard ;automated MR' mode and two case studies are used to show how to modify the automated search strategy for problematic cases.},

These preliminary conditions are then optimized to produce (in a perfect world) well diffracting crystals; this process of optimization often involves fine grid screening around the initial conditions. An issue in optimization is to find factors which are independent, so as to simplify the analysis of the results of optimization trials. This is necessarily difficult with buffers, as a buffer and its pH range tend to be very highly correlated. Multi-buffer systems for pH modulation are presented which enable a broad pH range to be sampled without changing the chemical composition of the buffering component.},

abstract = {The molecular-replacement method works well with good models and simple unit cells, but often fails with more difficult problems. Experience with likelihood in other areas of crystallography suggests that it would improve performance significantly. For molecular replacement, the form of the required likelihood function depends on whether there is ambiguity in the relative phases of the contributions from symmetry-related molecules (e.g. rotation versus translation searches). Likelihood functions used in structure refinement are appropriate only for translation (or six-dimensional) searches, where the correct translation will place all of the atoms in the model approximately correctly. A new likelihood function that allows for unknown relative phases is suitable for rotation searches. It is shown that correlations between sequence identity and coordinate error can be used to calibrate parameters for model quality in the likelihood functions. Multiple models of a molecule can be combined in a statistically valid way by setting up the joint probability distribution of the true and model structure factors as a multivariate complex normal distribution, from which the conditional distribution of the true structure factor given the models can be derived. Tests in a new molecular-replacement program, Beast, show that the likelihood-based targets are more sensitive and more accurate than previous targets. The new multiple-model likelihood function has a dramatic impact on success.},

In this review, we particularly focus on complex formations and the redox chemistry of catechols, which play an inportant role in the toxicity of catechols. In the presence of heavy metals, such as iron or copper, stable complexes can be formed. In the presence of oxidizing agents, catechols can be oxidized to semiquinone radicals and in a next step to o-benzoquinones. Heavy metals may catalyse redox reactions in which catechols are involved. Further chemical properties like the acidity constant and the lipophilicity of different catechols are shortly described as well. As a consequence of the chemical properties and the chemical reactions of catechols, many different reactions can occur with biomolecules such as DNA, proteins and membranes, ultimately leading to non-repairable damage. Reactions with nucleic acids such as adduct formation and strand breaks are discussed among others. Interactions with proteins causing protein and enzyme inactivation are described. The membrane-catechol interactions discussed here are lipid peroxidation and uncoupling. The deleterious effect of the interactions between catechols and the different biomolecules is discussed in the context of the observed toxicities, caused by catechols.},

abstract = {Inducible expression systems in which T7 RNA polymerase transcribes coding sequences cloned under control of a T7lac promoter efficiently produce a wide variety of proteins in Escherichia coli. Investigation of factors that affect stability, growth, and induction of T7 expression strains in shaking vessels led to the recognition that sporadic, unintended induction of expression in complex media, previously reported by others, is almost certainly caused by small amounts of lactose. Glucose prevents induction by lactose by well-studied mechanisms. Amino acids also inhibit induction by lactose during log-phase growth, and high rates of aeration inhibit induction at low lactose concentrations. These observations, and metabolic balancing of pH, allowed development of reliable non-inducing and auto-inducing media in which batch cultures grow to high densities. Expression strains grown to saturation in non-inducing media retain plasmid and remain fully viable for weeks in the refrigerator, making it easy to prepare many freezer stocks in parallel and use working stocks for an extended period. Auto-induction allows efficient screening of many clones in parallel for expression and solubility, as cultures have only to be inoculated and grown to saturation, and yields of target protein are typically several-fold higher than obtained by conventional IPTG induction. Auto-inducing media have been developed for labeling proteins with selenomethionine, 15N or 13C, and for production of target proteins by arabinose induction of T7 RNA polymerase from the pBAD promoter in BL21-AI. Selenomethionine labeling was equally efficient in the commonly used methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) (found to be metE) or the prototroph BL21(DE3).},

abstract = {AutoDock Vina, a new program for molecular docking and virtual screening, is presented. AutoDock Vina achieves an approximately two orders of magnitude speed-up compared with the molecular docking software previously developed in our lab (AutoDock 4), while also significantly improving the accuracy of the binding mode predictions, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development. Further speed-up is achieved from parallelism, by using multithreading on multicore machines. AutoDock Vina automatically calculates the grid maps and clusters the results in a way transparent to the user.},

@article{Vagin2004,
abstract = {One of the most important aspects of macromolecular structure refinement is the use of prior chemical knowledge. Bond lengths, bond angles and other chemical properties are used in restrained refinement as subsidiary conditions. This contribution describes the organization and some aspects of the use of the flexible and human/machine-readable dictionary of prior chemical knowledge used by the maximum-likelihood macromolecular-refinement program REFMAC5. The dictionary stores information about monomers which represent the constitutive building blocks of biological macromolecules (amino acids, nucleic acids and saccharides) and about numerous organic/inorganic compounds commonly found in macromolecular crystallography. It also describes the modifications the building blocks undergo as a result of chemical reactions and the links required for polymer formation. More than 2000 monomer entries, 100 modification entries and 200 link entries are currently available. Algorithms and tools for updating and adding new entries to the dictionary have also been developed and are presented here. In many cases, the REFMAC5 dictionary allows entirely automatic generation of restraints within REFMAC5 refinement runs.},

@article{Vogt2004,
abstract = {A recently discovered, S-adenosyl-L-methionine and bivalent cation-dependent O-methyltransferase from the ice plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, is involved in the methylation of various flavonoid and phenylpropanoid conjugates. Differences in regiospecificity as well as altered kinetic properties of the recombinant as compared to the native plant O-methyltransferase can be attributed to differences in the N-terminal part of the protein. Upon cleavage of the first 11 amino acids, the recombinant protein displays essentially the same substrate specificity as observed earlier for the native plant enzyme. Product formation of the newly designed, truncated recombinant enzyme is consistent with light-induced accumulation of methylated flavonoid conjugates in the ice plant. Therefore, substrate affinity and regiospecificity of an O-methyltransferase in vivo and in vitro can be controlled by cleavage of an N-terminal domain. ?? 2004 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

abstract = {The CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4) software suite is a collection of programs and associated data and software libraries which can be used for macromolecular structure determination by X-ray crystallography. The suite is designed to be flexible, allowing users a number of methods of achieving their aims. The programs are from a wide variety of sources but are connected by a common infrastructure provided by standard file formats, data objects and graphical interfaces. Structure solution by macromolecular crystallography is becoming increasingly automated and the CCP4 suite includes several automation pipelines. After giving a brief description of the evolution of CCP4 over the last 30 years, an overview of the current suite is given. While detailed descriptions are given in the accompanying articles, here it is shown how the individual programs contribute to a complete software package.},

abstract = {Current cloning technologies based on site-specific recombination are efficient, simple to use, and flexible, but have the drawback of leaving recombination site sequences in the final construct, adding an extra 8 to 13 amino acids to the expressed protein. We have devised a simple and rapid subcloning strategy to transfer any DNA fragment of interest from an entry clone into an expression vector, without this shortcoming. The strategy is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes, which cut outside of their recognition sequence. With proper design of the cleavage sites, two fragments cut by type IIs restriction enzymes can be ligated into a product lacking the original restriction site. Based on this property, a cloning strategy called 'Golden Gate' cloning was devised that allows to obtain in one tube and one step close to one hundred percent correct recombinant plasmids after just a 5 minute restriction-ligation. This method is therefore as efficient as currently used recombination-based cloning technologies but yields recombinant plasmids that do not contain unwanted sequences in the final construct, thus providing precision for this fundamental process of genetic manipulation.},

@article{Ibdah2003,
abstract = {Upon irradiation with elevated light intensities, the ice plant (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum) accumulates a complex pattern of methylated and glycosylated flavonol conjugates in the upper epidermal layer. Identification of a flavonol methylating activity, partial purification of the enzyme, and sequencing of the corresponding peptide fragments revealed a novel S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that was specific for flavonoids and caffeoyl-CoA. Cloning and functional expression of the corresponding cDNA verified that the new methyltransferase is a multifunctional 26.6-kDa Mg(2+)-dependent enzyme, which shows a significant sequence similarity to the cluster of caffeoyl coenzyme A-methylating enzymes. Functional analysis of highly homologous members from chickweed (Stellaria longipes), Arabidopsis thaliana, and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) demonstrated that the enzymes from the ice plant, chickweed, and A. thaliana possess a broader substrate specificity toward o-hydroquinone-like structures than previously anticipated for Mg(2+)-dependent O-methyltransferases, and are distinctly different from the tobacco enzyme. Besides caffeoyl-CoA and flavonols, a high specificity was also observed for caffeoylglucose, a compound never before reported to be methylated by any plant O-methyltransferase. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence and differences in acceptor specificities among both animal and plant O-methyltransferases, we propose that the enzymes from the Centrospermae, along with the predicted gene product from A. thaliana, form a novel subclass within the caffeoyl coenzyme A-dependent O-methyltransferases, with potential divergent functions not restricted to lignin monomer biosynthesis.},

@article{Kopycki2008b,
abstract = {Plant S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent class I natural product O-methyltransferases (OMTs), related to animal catechol OMTs, are dependent on bivalent cations and strictly specific for the meta position of aromatic vicinal dihydroxy groups. While the primary activity of these class I enzymes is methylation of caffeoyl coenzyme A OMTs, a distinct subset is able to methylate a wider range of substrates, characterized by the promiscuous phenylpropanoid and flavonoid OMT. The observed broad substrate specificity resides in two regions: the N-terminus and a variable insertion loop near the C-terminus, which displays the lowest degree of sequence conservation between the two subfamilies. Structural and biochemical data, based on site-directed mutagenesis and domain exchange between the two enzyme types, present evidence that only small topological changes among otherwise highly conserved 3-D structures are sufficient to differentiate between an enzymatic generalist and an enzymatic specialist in plant natural product methylation.},

@article{Vogt2004,
abstract = {A recently discovered, S-adenosyl-L-methionine and bivalent cation-dependent O-methyltransferase from the ice plant, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, is involved in the methylation of various flavonoid and phenylpropanoid conjugates. Differences in regiospecificity as well as altered kinetic properties of the recombinant as compared to the native plant O-methyltransferase can be attributed to differences in the N-terminal part of the protein. Upon cleavage of the first 11 amino acids, the recombinant protein displays essentially the same substrate specificity as observed earlier for the native plant enzyme. Product formation of the newly designed, truncated recombinant enzyme is consistent with light-induced accumulation of methylated flavonoid conjugates in the ice plant. Therefore, substrate affinity and regiospecificity of an O-methyltransferase in vivo and in vitro can be controlled by cleavage of an N-terminal domain.},

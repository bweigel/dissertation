\chapter{Evaluation of PFOMT towards the acceptance of long-chain SAM analogues}

\section{Introduction}

Small changes to molecules can have profound influences on their chemical, physical and biological properties.
Butyric acid esters differing only by a few methylene groups already exhibit quite divergent smells. 
However, not only the macroscopically qualitative properties can differ.
The quantifyable psychotomimetic effect of methylated and ethylated lysergic acid amids differ by at least an order of magnitude \citep{Shulgin1997,Hofmann2000}.
There are many more of these so-called \glspl{sar} and \glspl{qsar} studies on any number of compounds and situations \citep{Santos2014,Alexander1966,Mani1991}. \\
Methylation reactions are one of the key tailoring steps during natural product biosynthesis and can in consequence greatly affect a molecules bio- and physicochemical behavoir \citep{Struck2012,Ley2005}.
However, between the highly complex core structures of natural products, which are produced by a plethora of enzymes (e.g. \glspl{pks}, \glspl{nrps}, terpene cyclases), and the rather simple alkyl-modification introduced by methylation nature is missing some medium-sized modifaction options, that proceed as elegantly as the methylation by \glspl{mt}.
Thus, natural products containing longer chain alkyl modifications like ethyl or propyl moieties on O, N or S-centers have rarely, if ever been observed.\footnote{Reaxys searches for natural product isolates with a molecular mass between (150 and 1500) containing the substructures methyl, ethyl or propyl connected to a heteroatom return 66759, 2797 and 52 results respectively. However, it stands to note that 70\,\% of the propyl results were either esters or otherwise activated moieties. \citep{Elsevier}}


It has recently been shown however, that a wide array of \gls{sam} analogues are used as co-substrates by a variety of \glspl{mt} \citep{Struck2012}.  
The majority of the work so far has been done on \glspl{pmt} and \glspl{dmt} (\autoref{fig:d_lit_sam}), since epi-genetics and finding regions of gene-reulation is of great interest. 
There have been a great many of \gls{sam} analogues synthesized, both chemically and with the help of enzymes \citep{Dalhoff2006,Singh2014}.\\

    The black dash across the bar shows the number of times this substrate was actually converted by either enzyme.%    
    }

However, the first description of novel synthetic \gls{sam} analogues with extended carbon chains, including \gls{sae}, allyl and propargyl derivatives, that were also shown to be useful in modifying \gls{dna} via the action of several \glspl{dmt} was provided by Dalhoff, \etal \citep{Dalhoff2006,Dalhoff2006a}. 
It was also noted, that allyl transalkylation reactions proceeded much faster than ethyl- or propyl transfers possibly due to conjugative stabilization of the transition state \citep{Dalhoff2006}.
A whole variety of allyl derivatives was examined by different researchers and site-specific introductions of allyl, pent-2-en-4-ynyl and even 4-propargyloxy-but-2-enyl moieties into proteins (i.e. histones) was demonstrated using \glspl{pmt} \citep{Wang2011,Peters2010}.
However, the larger substrate analogues were not neccesarily accomodated by the native \glspl{pmt} making engineering efforts for the accomodation of larger substrates inevitable \cite{Wang2011}.
The specific introduction of alkine functionalized groups made it then possible to use click chemistry for further functionalization and/or detection of the labelled proteins, DNA or RNA and has been studied extensively (\autoref{fig:d_cuaac}) \citep{Wang2011,Peters2010, Motorin2011, Willnow2012,Schulz2013}.\\ 
In 2012 Bothwell and Luo even described the exchange of the sulfonium with a selenonium center, which afforded \gls{seam} analogues that have since then been described as substrates for several \glspl{pmt} \citep{Bothwell2012,Bothwell2014}.
\gls{seam} analogues have the advantage of being more resistant to chemical decomposition than their sulfur counterparts, but also show enhanced transmethylation reactivity \citep{Bothwell2014}.

   Depending on the type of label used, it can be employed for detection (e.g. through fluorophores, coupled assays) or affinity purification (e.g. biotin).
   This technique is also feasable for use in \glsentryfirst{abpp} approaches.%    
    }
  
There have also been some reports on the use of \gls{sam} analogues by small molecule \glspl{mt}.
In 2009 Stecher \etal reported the use of the \glspl{cmt} NovO and CouO along with synthetic \gls{sam} analogues to accomplish biocatalytic Friedel-Crafts alkyations of some aminocoumarine antibiotics \citep{Stecher2009}.
Lee \etal were the first ones to describe the transfer of a keto-group from an \gls{sam} derivative by means of the small molecule \glspl{mt} catechol \textit{O}-methyl transferase (EC 2.1.1.6) and thiopurine \textit{S}-methyl transferase (EC 2.1.1.67) \citep{Lee2010}.
Furthermore there was work done on the \glspl{omt} RebM and RapM, which modify the antitumor active natural products rebeccamycin and rapamycin respectively, that shows the general feasability of using \gls{sam} analogues in combination with \glspl{mt} to modify small molecules \cite{Law2015,Singh2014,Zhang2006}.
In all of these reports the specificity of the group transfer is retained despite the fact that \gls{sam} analogues are employed as substrates. \\
There is of yet no bioactivity data reported that shows the biological activity of the newly produced compounds.

\gls{pfomt} is highly promiscuous towards its flavonoid substrate \citep{Kopycki2008b,Ibdah2003}.
However, the promiscuity towards different \gls{sam} analogues has net yet been described.
Combination of both, substrate and co-substrate promiscuity in the small molucule \gls{mt} \gls{pfomt} could provide a powerful tool towards the biosynthestic production of novel small molecules with potentially new and promising biological activities.
Functionalization/Detection of substrates could furthermore provide a means of finding new compounds/substrates in complex (e.g. biological) samples analogous to \gls{abpp} approaches.
It was thus of interest, whether or not \gls{pfomt} would accept \gls{sam} analogues as alkyl donors.
The already extensively studied \gls{pfomt} was the prime candidate, since the preparation and crystallizability were established and lots of substrates had already been described \citep{Vogt2004,Ibdah2003,Kopycki2008b,Brandt2015}.


\section{Substrate binding studies using \glsentrytext{itc}}

The binding of different substrates by \gls{pfomt} was examined by \gls{itc}.
\gls{sah}, \gls{sam} and \gls{sae} were selected to study the influence of the alkyl chain length on binding.
Furthermore the binding of the substrate caffeic acid and the influence of \cf{Mg^2+} addition on substrate binding was investigated.

\section{Study of variants for long-chain alkylations}

The work described in this section was done in cooperation with Dr. Martin Dippe. Dr. Dippe did most of the work on the \gls{pfomt} variants described herein. \\

Since the ability to bind the enlongated analogue \gls{sae} was present in wildtype \gls{pfomt}, the activity of the \gls{pfomt} protein was tested.
Activity tests were performed with caffeic acid as substrate under standard reaction conditions.
The wildtype of \gls{pfomt} was able to use \gls{sae} as a co-substrate for the ethylation of caffeic acid, albeit the amount of detected product was very minute. \bweigel{literaturvergleich der ums√§zte?}
The site of ethylation was determined by \gls{lcms} measurements. \bweigel{LCMS messungen?}
It was found that ethylation occurs on the catecholic group, however it could not be determined whether at the 3- or 4-position.
Nonetheless it is highly likely that ethylation occurs at the same position as methylation and thus the product was annotated as 3-ethoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid. \\
Enzyme variants were prepared to further test the ethylation reactivity of \gls{pfomt}, since a number of groups were able to accomplish transalkylation with larger substrates by expanding the available space in the active site \citep{Wang2011}.
Residues that were exchanged were selected based upon their position in the active site and in relation to the substrate(s) (\autoref{fig:d_activesite_resis}).
Fortunately a crystal structure of \gls{pfomt} was available to help with the selection. \bweigel{Genauer zu den Resten...}

   The co-substrate \gls{sam} (ball-and-stick model) was docked into the structure. %    
    }

Over 20 enzyme variants were prepared to assess, whether \gls{pfomt} ethylation activity would improve over the wildtype.
Be that as is may, an improved ethylation activity was not observed. 
Some of the new variants however displayed an increased methylation activity with the substrates caffeic acid and \gls{sam}.
The methylation activity of some of the variants increased by over 4-fold \bweigel{grafik?}.
Interestingly most amino acid substitutions proved as beneficial, rather than detrimental.\\
Methylation activity benifited greatly from the replacement of bulky hydrophobic residues by smaller and/or charged residues in the vicinity of the acceptor substrates (Tyr51, Trp184 and Phe198).
However, this was not a general trend since the substitutions N202W and Y51W also improved methylation activity.
Looking more closely at residue Tyr51, the activity enhancing effect was greatest, when the tyrosine was substituted by the basic amino acids lysine or arginine.
In addition to an enhanced activity the selectivity for the hydroxyl position to be methylated was also altered in these variants.
This was not apparent, when caffeic acid was used as a substrate. 
However when a flavonoid, especially eriodictyol, was used not only the 3' hydroxyl, but to some extent the 4' hydroxyl was methylated.
This effect was improved in some double variants, where also position 202 was altered. 
For example the variant Y51R N202W almost exclusively methylated flavonoid substrates at the 4' position \bweigel{grafik? \& paper}.
A detailed discussion of the results was published in a peer reviewed journal.

\section{Determination of the structure of \emph{apo}-\glsentrytext{pfomt}}
The binding of the non-natural substrate \gls{sae} to \gls{pfomt} could be shown.
However, a transethylation reactivity was not observed.
The question was to the chemical reasons behind these observations.
Crystallization was sought to answer this question.

At first the already published crystallization procedures were evaluated to start with \citep{Kopycki2008b}. 
Albeit, reproduction of the results could not be accomplished and new crystallization conditions had to be found.
This was done using commercially crystallization screening kits and a semi-automated pipetting robot along with an automated imaging system for the observation of the crystallization plates.

Each buffer solution was screened in combination with three different protein solutions (\textit{A} -- 0.25\,mM \gls{sah}, 0.25\,mM \cf{MgCl2}, 0.25\,mM ferulic acid, 0.262\,mM \gls{pfomt}; \textit{B} -- 0.25\,mM \gls{sae}, 0.25\,mM \cf{MgCl2}, 0.25\,mM eriodictyol, 0.262\,mM \gls{pfomt} and \textit{C} -- 0.25\,mM \gls{sah}, 0.25\,mM \cf{MgCl2}, 0.25\,mM ferulic acid, 0.219\,mM \gls{pfomt} Y51R N202W) to obtain protein crystals co-crystallized with the substrates. \\
During the preparation of the protein solutions it was noted, that upon addition of the flavonoids or phenyl propanoids from \gls{dmso} stocks these tended to precipitate.
Thechniques meant to circumvent this problem are discussed in \autoref{sec:des}. 
Crystals began to appear in various wells after a few days and were observed for each tested protein solution at least once.
The crystal shape varied from very smooth and almost cubic (high ammonium sulfate) over sphreulites and intergrown crystals (\cf{CaCl2}, PEG-4000) to brittle and ragged needles (\cf{LiCl}, PEG-6000)  (\autoref{fig:d_xtals}).

This is the git project that build my [dissertation thesis](https://digital.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/ulbhalhs/urn/urn:nbn:de:gbv:3:4-20753).
I thought it would be a good idea to share this to the world. For people to see how messy it can be. Not sure it compiles anymore...
I know I used to have a `Dockerfile` that could build this monster, but cannot find it anymore...guess it wasn't so important after I got it printed.

Anyway...enjoy :)
